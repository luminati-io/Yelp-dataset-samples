I was first interviewed by an attorney named Lauren and Sandy van. Next time with the law firm to do interrogatories I meet an attorney named Ken , I think his name was. I found out Lauren no longer work there. The next time at the van law firm for deposition prep there was a person named Tracy. Tracy told me they depose the police officer and the truck driver. Found out later they did the Deposition of the officer but lied to me about the truck driver and lied to me about specific questions I ask her about the truck driver in the deposition  . At this meeting they told me they were going to ask for future care because I was still being treated,  As a matter of fact they pretended not to know I was still being treated and never had any of the medical bills for the said treatment, Tracy  next thing , She said she would have to postpone mediation. ""they were going to move to a mediation while I was still being treated?. I was still being treated by a doctor and seemed like I had hit the wall on getting better. He ordered up an MRI and neurosurgeon said that I would benefit from back surgery. I told Attorney  I was scheduled for surgery, Tracy took two weeks to get back to me and when she gets back to me, all she did was badger me and say my case will be thrown out of court if I get the surgery because I'm destroying evidence. Come to find out she never filed a motion for future care , Just one more lie! She said I need  to come up with $60,000 to pay for the medical liens. I was beside myself I did not know what to do. Tracy kept telling me I need to cancel the surgery or come up with 60000 . Now because of her incompetence she wants me to be in pain longer? The law firm that is representing me in my best interest? They don't want me to get better from my injuries, badgering me and telling me lies. I dropped that firm and went to another firm they did an excellent job. I really don't enjoy writing this kind of review but, I think it is important for my fellow  Americans to know what to watch out for, this could happen to you.  This is a question for  Sandy what would you have done if you was treated this way after being injured in Motor vehicle  accident and being told by an attorney that was supposed to be representing me that I have to cancel surgery because they didn't ask for futures? If that incompetent attorney would have done what they said they did there would not have been  a problem. I stayed up all night studying and trying to figure out what was happening and then I knew I had to find a new attorney, this is Attorney operates under your name and you're responsible for her ethics.... Once again all I wanna do is let people know what my experience was and I hope you won't make the same mistake I did. Sandy Van had the nerve to call the attorney that successfully represented me and ask him if he would ask me to take down my review,, To this day she will not return my call or even talk to me. She knows her law firm has dirty hands in the way they handled my case. Thanks for your time reading and good luck to everybody that's injured in a car wreck... Update, Sandy van did finally return my call and we had a decent conversation, I'm still a little bit on the fence on what to do because what happened in my case was really not Sandy Vans fault. Although I believe she does carry some of the burden because the attorneys working for her are working under her name. Tracy D was the Attorney That never filed a motion asking for futures and wanting me to delay surgery because of her mistake. There's a few other things that she did that shows her unprofessionalism such as some of the motions that I got my hands on. But when it comes down to it the Most ironic thing of all The 702 law firm settled my case and I thought they were very professional but ,then they just hired Tracy and as a new member of their team. Tracy is the attorney that screwed up my case at the van law firm!the 702 law firm picks it up and settles it and then hires the person that screwed up.. all I can say is I'm sure glad it's all over with,, Good luck with getting hurt in an accident,, Insurance companies are certainly not going to do the right thing and it's a little crapshoot and rather you're going to find a good attorney.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""Ely, NV"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":26,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MUNOT95TX4yXnomGvxFQqQ"",""Username"":""Jim J.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Jim,\n\nI remember when the answering service woke me up at 3 or 4 in the morning, perhaps it was 6 am in the morning.  We had a long and great discussion regarding the facts of your case and I actually enjoyed speaking to you Jim and felt great empathy for your situation.  I do not like insurance companies just as much as you don't. \n \nAs I own and run a small woman-owned business and am just trying to grow my small business,  these bad reviews can be totally devastating to our small business.  We rely on good reviews to help grow our business. \n\nI received your 1 star reviews at midnight on Christmas Eve across several of our platforms.  \nAs it was a 4 day holiday weekend and all of my employees were off, there was not much that I could do.  No one would take time from their family and the holidays to help me piece together what had occurred. \n \nI finally was able to speak to Tracee and the law clerk who was handling your file, they said that there may be some things that you may not understand and things that we wish to clarify with you.  We were trying to act in your best interests and sometimes \""the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\""\n  \nAs you terminated our services and sought new counsel we were unable to communicate with you pursuant to the State Bar ethics rules.  For us to clarify everything, we should schedule a meeting to talk.  I am here if you want to discuss this so that we can tell you our side of things.  We were just trying to help and maybe it was not taken that way.  I have been misunderstood before and sometimes it is not that great to see one's point of view or to communicate in writing when you cannot convey inflection, tone, etc.\n\nWe were not entirely without fault and yes as human beings we made some mistakes, but not exactly to the degree that you make it seem.  Yes, we had some employee shifts due to employee health reasons and other issues, sometimes employees come and go.  \n\nWe worked on your case for a few years and we were in active litigation.  Then the pandemic hit and we, like the courts, like the state, and like the world, everything stopped for a few months.  We transitioned to working from home, the courts issued several executive orders one after another, making it difficult for trials, depositions to continue in a timely fashion.  Like everyone else in the world, we were just trying to figure things out.  Right about that time, you terminated your relationship with us and we could no longer communicate with you to share with you why we did what we did.\n\nCases are very lengthy processes.  Sometimes spanning 2 to 3 years or more depending on the type of case and what is at stake.  Just as in year-long personal relationships where people come and go, in businesses employees sometimes come and go.  Nothing in life is certain and permanent.\n\nDue to the State Bar ethics rules and client confidentiality, I cannot state facts in this forum and therefore I cannot defend myself, my team, or my firm.  We do not want to run afoul of the State Bar rules and jeopardize our licenses.  If you would like to schedule a time to hear our side of the story and to discuss things, we would be happy to do so.\n\nIf you don't want to and you want to go on with your life and beliefs, we respect that.  We are glad that you have found a resolution to your case and we wish you the best.\n\n\n\nSandy"",""Date"":""29/12/2020"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/u7YPoV4_guq0em5-LggXYw/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Sandy V.""},{""Content"":""Avoid this law firm!

This frustration is completely directed at the case management side. From February to August 2023 I never got a single update about my case. It wasn't until I called their office directly and got to speak with my lawyer, Angela, did I learn that I was supposed to receive monthly updates regarding my case and even she herself regarded my experience as unacceptable. That's when she took it upon herself to personally update me on my case.

Went to pick up my check today and was told by the receptionist that my case management Karin would be with me in a little bit. Two hours later, I run into Karin myself only for him to tell me no one had told him that I was there.

Van law firm reached out to me within the minute of sending my inquiry and I'm glad she did. She sent over her assistant Karin to my house within an hour. Karin was just as helpful the first time I met him as well as during the entire process. Always there to answer my questions, as this had been the first accident I had of this caliber. 

I was scheduled to see a chiropractor and a physical therapy specialist the very next day after the accident on a Saturday!! I mean if that doesn't scream professional and reliable I don't know what is! The people I went to see were amazing and I can't thank them enough for helping me get back to normality physically. 

My car took a month to get fixed and although it was heartbreaking to see my car that was less than a year old look the way it did I was happy with the final results. My car looks the way it did before going to the shop of Karins recommendation using all original parts and paint. 

The whole case lasted about 5 1/2 months and I received an amazing settlement check yesterday! What I thought to have been one of the worst days of my life ended up being a pleasant experience to a bad event thanks to Van Law Firm and Karin.

Its so bad, my breaks were horrible and making noise after a week as if some spray was put on for it to be silent while I test drove. Complete rip over! Each week something else was wrong with the car... the air condition stop working, they put BMW rotors on my C300 and I found out only after my second time taken the car to them to get the brakes fixed which never got actually fixed I end up taking it to my neighbor mechanic who told me it was BMW rotors. Second week my car over heats but yet the car is tweaked to not show service issues, I take it end it yet later I find out another bandaid fix. Going into the second month with the car my I start having problems turning on the car on I was left to pay all the repairs 
It was such a scam and horrible experience I refused to pay the car note without them fixing the issues. Idk call it ignorant but it hurts your soul when you drop over 30% pay on time but yet all these issues keep happening and I was not going to pay for a car that gave me problems turning it on.
You feel like your dealing with a mob ran dealership no honesty & integrity in anyone from the desk girls to the humble looking hard working car washers on the lot, they all have been trained & scripted to play the part. 


LIST OF THINGS TO NOTE
- They say 30% and if you have it so you don't worry, then they get on the phone with ""The Bank"" and tell you the finance company is asking for more. 
- Eddie the Latino mechanic will only bandaid and keep your car for hours to make it seem like they actually did the ""work"" 
-They Don't even report that you pay currently on time to the creditors. 
- STATEWIDE will change your payment date without telling you. 
- Sam & Jack are the same person I believe if you see a old Middle Easter, Armenian looking old guy usually with a hat showing you around the cars it's him. 

I AM PUTTING TOGETHER A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT

Have been going to Audi Seattle on and off for about a decade but don't think I can do it anymore.  Originally they had their post service surveys where they literally beg you to give them 10s.  They offer those anymore and I don't think that is a coincidence.

My last experiences were too much to continue going back.  The first my rear brake caliper failed at 34k miles. Granted it was a few months past the warranty, I figured they may assist with a good will repair. After all, this shouldn't really happen at 34k let alone 100k.  They refused to assist and came out to $1,500.  The former is fine, but please don't lie about how you tried so hard to help and have each person I talk to give a completely differently conflicting story.

They are pretty damn convenient, so I end up showing up again. I take my car in and get a final bill much higher than my original quote.  They then claimed certain items were not covered by the TDI settlement.  After talking to a couple people, they miraculously figured out I was right.

We normally would like to go to Capital Grille aa Fleming's; however, in the Toledo area.  I must say that the standard restaurant holds its own that company! Ambience was lovely. We chose to sit at the bar. Carla and Emma, where are bartenders/servers.  Their personal and professional service was one of the highlights of our visit.  To open, we ordered adult beverages, Manhattan for me and glass of Vino for my wife. The Manhattan was perfect!  For a starter, we shared the Burrata and Pears appetizer. The flavors were perfectly pan were delicious appetizer. I decided to order their small filet Oscar style while my wife ordered their pork chop. Both dishes were amazingly delicious!  I ordered a side of sautéed garlic rapini to go with my steak. It was the perfect vegetable to offset the steak!  To top everything off, we decided on their blueberry lemon cheesecake. That dessert was superb! Not sure if we'll ever be in Toledo again, but if we are, we'll do our best to stop here.

Once done with apps it seemed to take forever for our meal to come. They kept saying it's coming but it took forever. Once food did arrive I would say it was just okay. Pretty bland and flavorless for Cuban food. My dad ordered boiled yuca and it tasted like nothing. No flavor no seasoning what so ever. After finishing meals it then took a long time again for desserts to come. They were good. For the price of the food there it should really have been more flavorful and better service.

"spoons-place-canton-2","""21/01/2018""",1,"Edit: This place gets 1 star now because the owner decided to make fun of my review on social media because I was unhappy they didn't offer a children's menu. I guess he doesn't have children or if he does, never took them out to dine. Shameful. 

I was excited to try it, but left feeling just kind of ""ah"" about it. Not a family friendly establishment because they do not have a kids menu. I'd expect this from a more upscale restaurant, but Spoons Place is not upscale. Most of the time when my husband and I dine out, we have our children, so we will choose a place that is more accepting of our children in the future. By not having a kids menu, that's sending a clear message that kids are not welcome. And hey, that's fine but don't expect to get my business. Even Hooters has a kids menu. 

The service was good but the food was just subpar. Nothing unique about the menu. I was excited to try the ""crack Mac"" but it was some of the worst Mac and cheese I've ever had. I don't know what kind of cheese they use, but I felt like it left a weird film in my mouth. And as other reviews have mentioned, the place lacks style and decor. Seems like they were in a rush to open and forgot to decorate the place. It has so much potential.

The literal colors infused in this food drew me in!! So I decided to go check out @eatpowpow !! Located on 1253 H St, N.E. you can't miss their Pow Pow signage!! This is an Asian fusion spot with recipes from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan...pretty innovative I thought. So I stroll in there ready to order, was partially greeted, and then politely asked if I was there to pick up an order. After to told them no, it was explained to me that I have to order online, not in store. That was oxymoronic to me, I'm here let me order, and a tad bit inconvenient. This establishment lost 2 sets of customers with this rule...they left as I was standing there online ordering. Nonetheless the food was BOMB!! Their appetizers include Miso soup,  Sichuan dumplings, and their Firecracker fingers which are plant based chicken fingers tossed in a spicy sauce. I copped two appetizers their Trolley fries (pictured-hancut fries with kimchi, Korean ketchup, togorashi mayo, cashew cheddar, nori, and scallions $6). I will NEVER forget these fries, they were that good and as long as they are in business...I'm snatching them up!! Savory, spicy, crunchy...EVERYTHING!! I also got their Taiwanese fried Buffalo mozzarella (pictured-fried cashew cheese croquettes with Korean ketchup). If you didn't these were vegetarian, you wouldn't know these were vegetarian!! Like that!! Especially dipped into that sauce!! Ok for entrees they have a number of bowls where you can pick your rice, and protein (please see their simplified menu). I chose their K-town bbq bowl (pictured-Korean bbq grilled plant based chicken, black beans, tomato, pineapple kimchi, cilantro, fried shallots, with sesame drizzle $12 for a large). This meal didn't disappoint either. The blend of colorful flavors had my palate awestruck!! A truly delightful meal. I also got a watermelon Kombucha...I'm not a fan. Customer service was ok, not the best, parking is on H street so good luck, but the establishment was squeaky clean. I'm geeking for some more as I write this, I'm going back!!

I give up. Huge portions are appropriate for the huge price tags. Come prepared to split a platter. Most platters are waaay more calories than the daily recommended allowance for an average adult. For the price you could go to a real deal nice restaurant. You order at the counter, get a number, help yourself to a fountain drink and the salsa bar. Sometimes the order line is short & quick, sometimes long & slooow. Sometimes the food comes fast, sometimes just when you think they lost your order the food arrives. The quality of the food is good, nothing unique but it meets that expectation level of a family style generic Mexican restaurant. I'm not mad at Chileno's. It's an alright experience. I think my big epiphany is this: I don't want that much freaking food in one serving. It's gross. I don't want to have to negotiate a split with someone. I don't want to have to scrape half a plate away into a to-go container before I even start to eat so it look so overwhelming. Sometimes I just don't want leftovers. A lot of people like leftovers and like that feeling of excessive abundance. If that's you, jackpot!

"masa-of-echo-park-los-angeles","""10/07/2018""",4,"I have been WAITING AND WAITING to come here because I heard they had really good Chicago deep dish pizza. I HAD to personally experience this. 

I heard there was a long wait for pizzas if I ordered at the restaurant so I phoned in my order and the lady said it would take about 20 mins. I get to the restaurant in 17 minutes and patiently anticipate eating my pizza. I wait and wait and a total of 50 minutes have gone by since I phoned in my order. I began to grow impatient and wondered where the heck my pizza has been. There weren't many tables around me so it seemed odd. 

My pizza comes and the waitress is amazed by how much cheese the chef put in the pizza. She pulls a slice out and it was the most amazing cheese stretch ever. I cut into the pizza and my taste buds exploded as I was hit with cheese, tomato sauce, sausage, mushrooms, and the extraordinarily crunchy crust. My favorite part of the pizza was the crust. It's was oddly familiar and, most importantly, the flakiest crust I have ever had. I did not feel the pizza was too greasy and it managed to retain its structure despite being layered with so many ingredients. 

I highly recommend everyone to come to Mass and try out the Chicago deep dish pizzas as it is an experience on its own. The medium deep dish is perfect for 4 people on my opinion and it is very affordable (~$23).","{""Friends"":745,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/OLtAIC9rqBfIbJmKfWYlSQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Norfolk, VA"",""Photos"":1429,""Reviews_made"":173,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=skPCqo1U-nq2odLKFGvp9A"",""Username"":""Byron T.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Itxb2IeAcn4k-BnqIrO9tg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YOsoAuQrGgA2fOgcD6ceYA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jzVoqHEaEf88LJVojgORIw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bD68pv07KCiIXTqs-tmo9g/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",309,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Masa of Echo Park"

The actual movers who come are a different crew from the person you've been in contact with all along (and you don't hear from that person again once the move starts). Two of my movers were nice but one was a hot head and kept starting arguments over things, and it made my move very stressful and scary. I get the sense this company doesn't treat their movers right, and that's why they are a ball of stress and it reflects on how they treat customers. I also didn't realize that if your inventory isn't 100% accurate, this company will use it as an opportunity to nickel and dime you. It's really hard to get a 100% accurate inventory before you've finished packing. If you leave out a vacuum cleaner, trash can or a coffee machine, you'll be charged (in my case, an extra $250)! I felt misled by how kind and supportive my sales representative was - the actual move was very unpleasant. They also DROPPED MY TV during the move and didn't tell me.

I had the fusilli in agliolio sauce which is olive oil, garlic and roasted garlic.  My pasta came as a side to the mahi mahi special which was a Parmesan crusted mahi filet fried to perfection smothered in butter.

One typical gripe I have with most restaurants in Florida is that they don't salt enough because of all the geezers with high blood pressure.  This was a minor problem at Agliolio, they only required a pinch of salt to bring the meal to perfection.

Our meal, Glass of wine, glass of Sweet Tea, Fried Mozzarella appetizer, spaghetti and Sunday sauce, two ceaser salads (up charge for ceasars) and Mahi Mahi special came to less than $55 not including the tip which we were glad to include because the service was spot on

The shrimp was out of the world. Like yum! The Cajun sauce was fantastic. We were sorry to have asked for the smaller bucket because we inhaled the shrimp and all the sauce possible. The gumbo was not very good. I LOVE gumbo and I've had such delicious gumbos in NOLA that this one was just plain disappointing. The seafood plate came with grilled fish, grilled shrimp and grilled veggies. The sauce was pretty good. Over all decent plate which we finished pretty quickly.

Note: Second bread is not free. I still ordered a second because it was just that good. 

Masa Traditional Pizza: Many many years ago, I tried Masa's Traditional (Masa's Secret Recipe Sweet Italian Sausage & Mushroom) Deep Dish Pizza, and I remember the pizza tasted salty. But on my recent trip, the pizza wasn't salty, which was my biggest concern. It was terrific. I thought the sausage patty covering the pizza was creative and an enjoyable sight, rather than a group of sausage balls, for meat lovers. The concept reminded me of Kafta Bajeen. 

Note: Pizza takes approximately 45 minutes, so I would recommend ordering ahead or ordering another dish while waiting.  

Masa Penne: This is their signature pasta (sundried tomato pesto, mushroom, cream sauce topped with crispy leeks), and I would highly recommend this plate as well.

Barcade coming in March '16

I like this place, a lot.  It's kind of a shame that there are so many other dining choices in Columbus as this place gets lost in the shuffle.  I had lunch with Mark K. there recently and had their excellent Grilled Salmon Sandwich which came on a Ciabatta roll with a spinach artichoke spread.  It came with a side so I choose the mixed green salad.  My take on the price vs what you get?  That $12.49 I paid was money well spent.  I would get it again in a heartbeat.

Just for reference:  I've also had their Cheeseburger, Reuben, Truffle Mac and Cheese, Fish and Chips and Pretzel Sticks - it's all been good.  I've never had a bad meal or a bad experience here.

*They are currently putting in a barcade upstairs, should be done soon but for the moment, there's a lot of noise and construction to deal with.  It should be interesting to see what they do with it.

I had an early morning drive leaving Twin Falls for Paul and I crossed over the canyon and thought... ""this is the most majestic thing I've ever seen."" Then headed back for Twin and stopped at Shoshone Falls and thought surely... ""this has to be the most majestic thing I've ever experienced."" Then while searching Yelp to carefully find and select the best local spot for dinner, I came across this unique restaurant with quite the number of positive reviews. I was warmly welcomed and seated upon entering. 

Having heard about the type of food before, I knew I wanted to try the cevapi (seasoned ground beef sausage). And so I looked briefly at the menu before getting a recommendation by the host to try 1/2 an order of Cevapi Sarajevski and the other 1/2 Sis Cevapi -- both coming with chopped onions, sour cream, Ajvar (vegetable bruschetta spread), and Bosnian flatbread. It wasn't long before the freshly grilled meats & bread landed before me -- the flavorful scents filling the room -- and I took that first bite and instantly triggered a Wow Moment and knew right away.... ""This is the most majestic thing I've tried & tasted to date, hands down!!!""

"advanced-exteriors-la-mesa-2","""07/05/2016""",1,"Advanced Exterior's response is flawed.  To say we were out of their area doesn't  make sense since they were more than excited to provide an estimate and the owner was on his way, albeit running late.  Not because of a rain shower, but because he didn't value the customer's time.  His response talks about rain on the mountain is funny. I was there, he says he was over a half hour away in the city, he had no way of knowing if it was raining or not.    The reality was that he was going to be so late  that my wife had to leave and that is when he said he was going to turn around.  See, as in the other reviews, they use high pressure sales tactics to get you to sign right then and there, before you realize how much more their product costs or get reviews from the BBB or Yelp.    As to say that Palomar Mountain is out of their service area was just another excuse.  In fact, they told me they had nearly a dozen customers on the mountain already.  What's the truth?  Can't have it both ways!   The owner said to me that Palomar Mountain is just too dangerous for his employees and he has a right to decide what neighborhoods he will work in.  Just like the cake maker saying who they will bake cakes for or redlining from years ago, he picks what neighborhoods and who he will work for.  Then I found out that he secretly records his conversations.  Why?  Creepy?  Illegal....yes, read California penal code section 632a.  This company was not honest with me.  The product may be great but per them cost about three time that of a great paint job.  In my books, I could have my home repainted every 8 years and still be ahead.  Remember, the owner was on his way but was running way late, that should say enough about the honesty of  his response  about being out of the area and the rest of his story.  They knew they lost a sale when I had time to check the reviews and get other estimates.  A product that sells itself doesn't need both parties to be present during the pitch, if it is so good, it will be easy to signatures later.  These are the same tactics used in time shares and car purchases.  Read the reviews, look at other options, take your time, don't let anyone pressure you, negotiate, and like me and others, you can shop elsewhere.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""San Diego, CA"",""Photos"":2,""Reviews_made"":37,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MN_STMwTKvXIjCfaqNWxJw"",""Username"":""Chris S.""}","null","[{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""We reserve the right to refuse to quote or do business with anyone if it is not in the best interest of the prospective customer or Advanced Exteriors, Inc.

After about a 20 minute wait we were lucky to be seated at Gwendolyn's table.  She methodically went through her paces, listening, suggesting and accommodating.  We got great service and she got a significant tip.

Wines by the glass and not two-buck Chucks.  Decent selections.  The Alamos Argentina Malbec was excellent.

Did not care for the Texas onion appetizer as it was small fried pieces, greasy and not very tasty.  But the rest of our order was excellent. 

I had Flo's Filet with real mashed potatoes and an excellent heaping green salad topped with house-made ranch dressing.  Dreading that the steak would be cooked into dryness I was delighted to find it cooked to text book medium.  A warm red center was nestled in the middle and the meat was very delicious.  They have good quality fillets.

I have had a couple of dishes here, Mie Hokkian, Nasi Campur, Laksa Udan (curry soup), and Nasi Kari Rendang, and they are all so delicious!!! I especially love Laksa Udan. Creamy curry soup is oh so good... I am not a big fan of heavy oily food, and dishes here are not light, but I can enjoy it for some reason. It is definitely worth trying once!!

The inside ambiance is definitely cute, super noisy, and obviously crowded. Out on the patio, there are very small tables and chairs. It was almost comical to watch grown men sitting & having drinks at a table that looks like it is designed for toddlers.

We started off with chips and salsa. These were highly disappointing. You literally receive 3 small tortillas and break them up for yourself and the others you're with. This serving size was enough to satisfy maybe 2 people?? And on top of it, I was charged for this appetizer (which is usually complementary at a normal Mexican food restaurant!) The service was okay, the waitress explained to me how the menu worked and happily answered my questions. Although, she did seem rushed. For example, I asked
for chips and salsa and she was gone before I could ask to order drinks. The actual tacos were average, I recommend ordering 3-5 depending on the type. I've definitely had better & cheaper street tacos at food trucks off of the highway.

Spicy shrimp lettuce wraps
Tuna ceviche
Seared yellowfin tuna burger
Crispy california halibut tacos
Solbar pizza

The lettuce wraps, ceviche and halibut tacos were all quite good with fresh ingredients and light, refreshing flavors.  On the other hand, the yellowfin tuna burger was pretty average with the bottom half of the bun completely soaked through and soggy to the point that one couldn't eat it with his/her hands.  The pizza was pretty subpar as well - no distinct flavors or textures...except for overdone dough that scratched up the roof of my mouth as I ate it.  Bleh.

Food: I'll start backwards because their pancakes were the stuff you get at summer camp as a kid. Flat limp and no air. 

The scrambled eggs lacked air as well but also salt and creaminess. Could use a dollop of butter in the cooking process. 

The French toast scrambled egg dish was actually really tasty and refreshing but separately. The feta cheese scramble part was good but the French toast was just a piece of toast. Lacked the cinnamon egg wash tastiness. 

Eggs Benny didn't have the poached egg yolk run which is the only red flag you need.

"la-ventana-latin-restaurant-miami-beach-miami-beach-2","""09/12/2018""",5,"This place makes you feel like you're in Colombia from the music to the ambience to the hospitality and authentic food. It's a very cozy place and every table was filled around lunch time. There was some outdoor seating on the sidewalk as well however, we choose to eat in the bar area instead to waiting for a table. Plus there was a socket there and I needed to charge my phone so it worked out perfectly. The manager Christian was warm and welcoming and did an excellent job in explaining the menu and pointing out some of the favorites. He also greeted every table and made sure customers had everything they needed.

We opted to try their fresh squeezed juices in which they offer three kinds - La Vida, Happiness, and On the Beach. My personal favorite was On the Beach which includes carrot, orange and strawberry. Next, we tried two of the appetizers the 3 Empanadas - one cheese, one beef and one chicken which included a very spicy sauce on the side. These empanadas had a different taste than empanadas I've tried in the past and I would say they were okay. We also tried the Carne Asada Quesadilla which was absolutely amazing. The sweet and savory flavors mix together so well and was by far the best Quesadilla I've ever tasted. It included marinated steak, avocado, pickled onions, plantains, cotija cheese and spicy mayo. I will definitely be back for this dish. For the main dish we chose the Bandeja Paisa and added Morcilla (blood sausage) which was delicious. It included palomilla steak, avocado, beans, rice, plantains, egg, fried pork and arepa. There was more than enough food to share.

My only con was that there wasn't a restroom directly inside the restaurant. The server had to unlock the door next door where one women's and one men's bathroom was located which didn't look nice. And although it did take a while to receive the food as it was busy during lunch time the Colombian music and beautiful decorations makes you feel like you are in Colombia and want to lounge there for a while to take in the experience.","{""Friends"":1,""Location"":""Chicago, IL"",""Photos"":71,""Reviews_made"":4,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o0dheaplpfU85Oj1MnILdw"",""Username"":""Cierra M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5yK8P5byau0bowDVibDs1w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3zaOpgAdVrQ81C5gPFG00A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DM6Hpv7S09YxWa2xygcwYQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RDfdT2fliUbsybU1gb-UMQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LEzVF_BuNsKQqEJ3rBSlqQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LBdVNu0Uns1THkYzGVKMqw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/sAZDv_8vQXRTVpb6OxB9XQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/b0Zg5zLVvMTw4IHxNsWn6w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9CUky_imE1kaP6mk3CWesQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DHR9P9T2GDwvKfpx7Keexw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",1104,"","0 check-in","La Ventana Latin Restaurant Miami Beach"

I wish I could tell you her name but she did a fabulous job dealing with us. I like the vibe of the restaurant but it is small, I think it'd be cool to sit outside though. The food made up for everything though. I started with a Caesar salad and had the lasagna which is bigger than it looks- but oh my if I had the strength to finish it I would have because it was to die for.

Food (5/5): We loved the food so much that we ended up dining here twice during our holiday. Recommend starting your meal by sharing the smoked chicken tacos with a side of sautéed vege - trust me, it's the best thing in the menu. The lobster roll is made to perfection and the side of fries are just the way I like it - CRISP. The gravy flavor for the southern fried chicken and biscuit was point on, I was glad that the meal was not swimming in gravy. The wings was our least favorite dish.
Service (5/5): we did not have to wait during the peak dinner hours, I would recommend a reservation for larger parties. The server gave us a run down of what the restaurant is famous for which is anything smoked and the sauces/gravies.

I showed up at 7:30 to complete my paperwork as their email instructed.  They were closed and after several minutes, someone came to the door and told me they don't open until 8.  But they gave me paperwork which I completed in my vehicle.   

There was one other person in front of me so at 8, I handed them my paperwork and took a seat.  Then I was asked for my drivers license and insurance card.  I didn't complete some info on the back of a form which I completed when asked.  I then was asked if I gave them the correct info on my employer.  I have worked there 37 years so I was sure I did.  I googled my employer and showed her.  

After a few minutes I asked if I could get my cards back.  I was told they were not finished verifying my employment (why would anyone verify my employment for a dental cleaning).  Finally at 8:35, I asked what time my appointment was and she confirmed 8 am.  I asked what was taking so long and she said they had 4 people in front of me...they all came in after me.  So it was going to be a while. 

I then asked for my dl and insurance card back because this was not working for me.  They disrespected my time and I told them.  She handed my cards back and said she could reschedule.  I said NO.  The lady that came in before me was also still waiting to be called back.

The only reason I was there was because my dental insurance changed and my excellent dentist, Dr Pate does not accept that insurance.  I wouldn't use Castle Dentist if they were the only dentist in town.

"massage-envy-clear-lake-webster-2","""25/11/2021""",1,"I had a 6 month membership and canceled after my 6 months were up. I had accumulated 4 hours of unused massage time and since I am pregnant and had one of their pregnancy massages (which I found subpar and actually left me feeling more tense than before) I asked if I could share/give my time to other people. The staff explained that I could transfer 1 hour of time + pay a $10 fee so someone else could use my massage. I went ahead and did that for my partner on Nov 18th. Afterwards, I went ahead and called and asked if I could transfer another hour to my mother for a surprise. They made sure it wasn't the same person as before and told me that I could indeed book the appointment. I had to reschedule the appointment and in person I even confirmed again to make sure my mother's appointment was still on. The manager was there and confirmed everything. 

Skip to the day of the appointment. Oh ""you can't transfer the hour to your mother because you already transferred 1 hour to someone else."" Yes but according to your manager, since she was a different person, and since she helped book the appointment, everything should have been transferred. ""Nope, we can't do that. Let me call and ask my manager."" Because of course, the manager wasn't at the actual location. Went to the back room, spoke to the manager, Denia Wright , and told me that I would have to pay the $65 ""member"" price for the massage that SHOULD have been covered. Since the manager was not there and the workers at the front desk all looked under 20 and clueless, no one could actually help me. So I had to pay an ADDITIONAL $65 for a massage that was already paid for because the workers there couldn't help me, and neither could the absent manager. No one had any common sense and due to an error on THEIR part, I still had to pay out of pocket. If they would have informed me BEFORE or when I made the appointment, OBVIOUSLY I wouldn't have scheduled the massage. But again, due to the retail workers and the manager at the Clear Lake Webster location, THEIR MISTAKE is now MY FAULT. Horrible customer service and I plan on letting everyone know that that location is NOT worth visiting.","{""Friends"":10,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/7jHiQBSzwCGm9_Hc_mXROQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Southeast Houston, Houston, TX"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":5,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qoRdM-2GjuDDyBHZwxALLg"",""Username"":""Samara R.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hello Samara, on behalf of Massage Envy Franchising thank you for expressing your concerns and bringing this to our attention.

But, the managers Yolanda and Art both came across with a cavalier attitude and left something to be desired.

Well, a fat lotta good they'll do ya! She haughtily huffed that someone else had requested the soccer game that was on. All she could do was recommend that we MOVE so we could see another TV! Really? There was NOBODY'S eyes gazed on that TV at ALL, so it was apparent she didn't want to be bothered with it! We decided to just hurry up and eat so we could get out of there...sure didn't feel like sticking around with that lack of customer respect/service. But on the way out, we had the total (dis)pleasure to also talk with the illustrious Art (another version of the same). He informed us that they weren't a ""sports bar"", but related that someone had requested the soccer game an HOUR AND A HALF AGO! Well guess what Art, those tables had been turned twice since then! Now that we know you could care less about your customers--and had notified us of the revelation that you aren't a sports bar--we'll never darken your door again on any day/night that football might be on.

There was a couple of restaurants next to them and one of them had live music. Which was great. The wine menu was good. Some of which I had and liked. Dinner menu was good as well. I'm not sure if it was limited due to covid. But what was on us quite a good array of choices. 

Started off with the clam chowder. And I can definitely say that it's one of the best I had on this trip. Maybe even the best. Main entree was the seafood spaghetti which was spectacular. They sure didn't skimp on the seafood. Shrimp, fish, etc.  Perfect pairing with the spaghetti and marinara garnish with fresh basil. Also the chicken parmigiana with rice and veggies.

Liked the super casual ambience, friendly and efficient service with local tap brews.  Not a very large restaurant, so you may have a short wait if coming during busy hours, but worth trying if you're like me and just love pizza!

Started with a dozen wings, 1/2 Louisiana hot and 1/2 Spicy BBQ.  These were nice and crispy outside, and tender inside.  They drizzle the sauce over the wings, so not completely tossed in sauce, but plenty flavorful.

Ordered a pepperoni, sliced Italian sausage, bacon and extra cheese large pie.  Each pizza made to order, liked the crunchy outer crust, generous portion of meats and cheese with a soft under crust. The red sauce was thick and tasty, but importantly didn't take away any flavors of the meats and cheese, nicely complemented the entire pizza.

"solbar-calistoga","""16/02/2011""",5,"During our weekend stay at the Solage, we had a chance to dine at their restaurant, Solbar. A stylish, yet very casual restaurant, with nice blond, hardwood floors, large windows, a long bar on one end of the restaurant, and a tall fireplace on the opposite end. 

DINNER: 
Before we checked into the hotel, I made reservations for dinner that evening. The restaurant that evening was intimately dark, with live guitar music being played near the bar. We were warmly greeted by the host, who seated us along one of the tables along the wall. We were greeted by an equally warm person from the waitstaff, and who went over the arrangement of their menu. 

Their menu is divided into two sections: a first course and a main course. With each section, menu items are written in two colors: green for ""healthier, lighter dishes,"" and red for ""hearty cuisine."" 

While looking over the menu, a basket of bread was placed on our table (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=yvAYprNnakItO2O4zjDHtw). In it were rosemary breadsticks, sliced baguettes, and corn muffins. Very nice! 

What we ordered: 
-Chilled Dungeness Crab (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=xDlAjr9YondVq9P05J5OzA): served with chicory salad with a meyer lemon foam dressing, crab leg, and crab meat on top of a tarragon puree. Very fresh, refreshing, and flavorful! 

-Seared Monterey Bay sardines (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=hQmzZC-vck3sa-kKsJqSrw): served with a meyer lemon, 
niçoise olive, piquillo pepper, and marjoram tapanade. I requested my dishes to be paired, and the sommolier asked if I wanted a wine or a spirit with this course. An interesting choice, and requested a spirit. He paired this dish with a pernod and water. A nice complement to this dish. The naturally oily texture of the sardines paired well with the refreshing pernod. 

-Slow-baked Loch Duart Salmon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=1eRZVRLcdUsDz1VvwdSv2g): served with preserved chanterelles, sage-pear purée, spinach, roasted cauliflower, and topped with bacon. The salmon was flaky, yet moist, almost on juicy. 

-Smoked Short Ribs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=n_OK539mZNnzTPCDhaAMng): Paired with mourvedre-Grenache-syrah relic ""ritual"". The short ribs were served on top of rosemary spaetzle, grain mustard, red wine braised cabbage. The meat was fork tender, and smokey, but not over powering. 

We were pretty full at this point, but I still wanted dessert. Our server recommended this: 
-Poached D'Anjou pear (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=DU3pdYd3Kzx3b2GVucIW5Q): Wine-poached pear stuffed with honeyed goat cheese, with a pear sorbet and walnut brittle. The restaurant manager noticed I didn't have have any pairing with dessert, so she served me a glass of a viognier, mer soleil ""late harvest"" dessert wine for my birthday. 
-------- 
LUNCH: 
As we were seated, freshly made rosemary salt buns, with a balsamic vinegar and olive oil bowl were placed on our table:

Here's what we ordered: 
-Warm Butternut squash bruchetta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=bjFwC7rn7F9yr-s-Ehy4Zg) 

-Red Endive and Escarole Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=fZeHCfv8jZJEgN2PORB2RQ)

-Petrale sole tacos (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=gdSlpmLB2U5sqLLSUdOeSA)

-Spicy Shrimp Lettuce Wraps (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=V1IZVTsPnmYxkIu92h4EEw) 

Everything for lunch was so well prepared.  They were indeed light tasting, yet  very satisfying.
------ 
BREAKFAST: 
-Pear juice (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=RLIW2QYiWmik-1q2uymx_Q)

-Coffee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=lFRg-zSL1-gINkqyYuMWBg): French-pressed 

-House made donut holes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=zv6fm9ai_JUTKiAZ5Pg2Mg): I heard so much about these, and had to order them. Made to order, and arrived hot to the table. Sugar-coating covered those hot and crispy goodies. 

-Side of fruit salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=8c6avJufXOhQXfEAy2zHyg): Colorful, and fresh. 

-Corn Beef Hash (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XITkuNFTKXeDKotFD9dPxA?select=idz_rIXAJFuXHOQTBZ5IMA): OMG, these were great. Corned beef just melted away with each roll of my tongue!

One of the best breakfasts we had a while.

My nails feel and look SO much better now! Michelle noticed right away how much lifting had occurred (Too much, she said, and I agree. This is bc the last place I went didn't even bother filing off the previous lifting--I've been doing this for two decades now I know the drill and that's not right!), the chunks of acrylic left under my nails, and how thick they were. Anyway she handled all that mess, plus my fill in, plus nail art with difficult colors (light yellow) in under an hour and even offered to add a little sparkle to my design to make it unique for me.

-Beef Tenderloin Steak Tacos: Star of the show were the crispy onions and jalapeños; this one was unexpectedly slightly sweet; the beef was really tender 
-Tropical Fish Tacos: tasted really clean; fish was super tender
-All three of the entrees above came with rice and beans (which were perfectly cooked and had subtle flavors)

"fambrinis-cafe-palo-alto","""28/10/2022""",5,"Holy smokes I think I found my favorite brunch spot! The line out the door really made me want to leave and go somewhere else, but surprisingly it was moving along at a reasonable pace which I later learned is because their kitchen is fast- love it! In terms of seating they have maybe 2 small tables inside where you order, but most seating is primarily outside which is great for when I went, but not sure how that will work for cooler months. 

Service being fast was such a huge plus and lucky for my party, we were able to find a table fairly easily after ordering and grabbing our numbers. So the food.....yes, pricey (what do you expect in Palo Alto?) But OH. SO. GOOD.  I ordered a salmon toast and it was delicious! You can tell the ingredients were fresh, egg perfectly poached and the presentation was just so beautiful! A plate of art. What blew me away was the Biscoff pancakes. Literally when the server was bringing it over, I said out loud ""oh my gosh!"" And almost squealed because of the sheer size of the stack of pancakes and how beautifully plated it was. The taste of the pancakes was heavenly (if you like Biscoff as much as I do, you'll feel the same way). The chef who came up with this dish deserves and award in my book. 

And my secret yelp tip for you all, the left over pancake is just as delicious the next day, especially if you top it off with more Biscoff crunchy cookie butter - you can thank me the next day.

"the-honey-paw-portland","""16/04/2015""",5,"Brand new and I already love it! Truly a one of a kind space and menu. Walk into this warm and inviting restaurant, and the first thing you is notice is that there are no individual tables. Visitors are either seated at the bar with a view of the open kitchen, along the windows (perfect for people watching and ocean views), or at the large communal table in the center of the room. Wherever you are seated the set up encourages meeting your neighbor, and contributes to a sense of community.  

The food was of course the star of the show. The menu is divided into 4 numbered sections, the numbers progressively  representing small plates through larger format dishes (big enough to share as an entrée  amongst a group). On this first visit my wife and I started with the crab and tofu fritters. These were served pipping hot and were the perfect combination of crispy fried with a rich pillowy filling. We followed this up with the charred pork shoulder that was reminiscent of what the perfect grown up boneless spare rib should be (I am slightly embarrassed to say this dish was so good,that despite the generous serving size I ordered a second). We followed this up with the Wok fried wide noodles with muscles,squid, and Chinese sausage. The dish is based on a Indonesian recipe taught to the chef by his much loved grandmother.

Stonebridge also bills for a ""Healthy Lawn Assessment"" which appears to be a fraudulent service.  They simply have someone look at your lawn and make basic notes that are apparent and obvious to the blind eye.  They justify this billing as part of a treatment plan but there is no treatment.  There is no valid and professional assessment.  There are zero recommendations on how to improve the conditions of the lawn.

1. Pancakes - no it's not your local ihop, it's about a million times better

"coopers-hawk-winery-and-restaurant-reston-reston","""02/07/2019""",2,"TL,DR: happy hour is great, dinner was horrible.

I love Cooper Hawk's happy hour, appetizers, drinks, etc. Ahi tacos and their take on a whiskey sour are delicious.

However, I had a horrible experience at dinner the other night. I ordered the trio of filets, medium. They came out OVER well done. I was so hungry that I ate one of them before telling the waiter about the horribly prepared dinner after he made his way over to us. I showed him one of the ""steaks"" which resembled a charcoal briquette, and he said ""I wish you would have told me earlier.""

I asked him to show the steak to the kitchen, but he came back and said ""he let the manager know.""

Sure enough, my dinner showed up full price on the receipt.

I honestly wasn't going to post a review until we grilled some filets at home last night. I even overcooked them accidentally and they still melted like butter in my mouth. I'm not even sure if the ""trio of filets"" are tender loin. They were so incredibly tough.","{""Friends"":12,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/13nAO0ZKwVaJMng6mhPOWw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Leesburg, VA"",""Photos"":6,""Reviews_made"":11,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=D7N0FC90jUmv5sXyvP2QxQ"",""Username"":""Sean C.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hello Sean, we would like to thank you for your feedback as well as apologize for your Cooper’s Hawk experience.

"cow-a-bunga-imperial-beach-3","""16/11/2020""",4,"Cow-A-Bunga is located at the main entrance to the Imperial Beach pier. This place serves up coffee, ice cream, and shaved ice. They have tons of flavors to pick from and also seasonal flavors such as Pumpkin ice cream.

 After a long day at the beach soaking up that beautiful San Diego sun and cool breeze this place just sounded right. The logo is pretty unique and cool with a cow on a surf board and in one hand is coffee while the other hand is ice cream. The line was fairly long but moved pretty quick with a one in one out system. We were thinking about having some dippin dots ice cream but went ahead with the shaved ice. We were allowed 2 flavors so we went for Watermelon, and blue raspberry. Within minutes I was handed my shaved ice and was out the door to snap my beautiful picture. The prices were very reasonable and cheap for a ice cream shop located on the beach. The shaved ice was perfectly built and they didn't skimp out on the flavored syrup. Both flavors were great and we enjoyed the nice refreshment with scenic views of the beach and waves. 

Ill definitely come back to this place the next time I visit and maybe enjoy some nice iced coffee or tub ice cream.

We were a little surprised of it's location and size but it definitely delivered. Located in a auto repair shop parking lot, it's 20 seat interior had cute country style decor. 

There were five of us and we we're say in 5/10 minutes. We all were pretty hungry so we started off with some orange juice and fried pig skin. The OJ was delicious. It was creamy and not pulpy. Probably the best fresh squeeze orange juice I've had. The fried pig skin took some time to arrive to our table and I didn't love them but I've never had it before so maybe it's just not my thing. It was crunchy and pretty greasy. 

For my meal I ordered the Croque Madame. You could tell the bread that was used was fresh and it was toasted perfectly. There was a generous amount of gruyere cheese and bacon. However, I would have loved to have the option on how I wanted my egg cook. I was hoping for a runny egg that I could break over my cheese covered toast but I received an over cooked egg instead. :(

I did not try any of my friends plates but was told they enjoyed their dishes. The table next to us had brought their own champagne. I wish I had known we could have done this so we could have had some delicious mimosas as well!

After 18 years in NYC and dealing with a variety of movers of varying degrees of sketchiness they were a breath of fresh air and SO professional. We got our initial estimate through Kristan Glancy who was very responsive and answered a myriad of questions for me. Due to the pandemic they were able to give their estimate of fees based on pictures I sent them of *all* our belongings and were able to give me a locked in quote. 

Once we had signed on with them Heather Tormanen one of their relocation specialists became our point person with the company. She was also extremely responsive and thorough. She dealt with all the weird nit-pickiness of our building's management company and all the extra documentation they needed because of COVID in a professional, thoughtful and thorough manner. 

We had a full pack move. The team of 3 gentlemen that packed up our apartment amazingly showed up 15 minutes earlier than planned to go through exactly what needed to be done and then were extremely efficient, respectful and careful with our belongings. They finished the pack up about an hour earlier than anticipated. 

When our belongings were en route to Texas, Heather was able to give us updates almost every day as to the status of where our stuff was and when it would be delivered. 

The delivery team on this end was great as well and very thorough and thoughtful. The system they use to track belongings was super useful and we could account for every box that had been packed up with a bar code system and inventory sheet. When we finished unpacking we found that *nothing* had been broken or misplaced...a first for me *ever* in moving. 

This was absolutely the best, most professional move of my life and I wasn't charged a penny over the quoted price.

"bad-roman-new-york","""24/07/2023""",5,"I came in with some friends for a 9pm reservation on a recent Saturday. Upon walking in, you are greeted by the hostess desk and the now infamous warthog statue. The inside is low light, red and gold, and feel chic. 
My friend and I had a beverage at the bar while we waited for our final party member (you cannot be seated without your full party). 
The pepperocini martini was good, without being overwhelming. 
To eat we started with the whipped ricotta with honey, roni cups w/ ranch, yellowtail crudo, and caesar salads. 
We all agreed that this was one of uber best caesar salads we had ever eaten. The dressing was perfect, lettuce fresh and crisp, and it had breadcrumbs instead of crutons, so you got it in each bite. 
The roni cups were obviously delicious, as who doesn't enjoy a crisp pepperoni cup. 
My friends enjoyed the yellowtail crudo and said it was fresh, but the portion was small. 
The whipped ricotta with honey was good, and we definitely finished it, but wasn't anything special I'd order again. 
For entrees we had the Penne Luongo Alla Gricia, which was similar to carbonara but less saucy. It came on long tubular pasta, and was filling and tasty; I would order this again. 
Next, the infamous Filletio w/ Cacio e Pepe Raviolo. This is NOT just one of those social media dishes. This was delicious. A perfectly cooked fillet, topped with a cascade of cacio e pepe sauce. You have to order it for the aesthetic, and the taste. 
We also had the Lobster Tail Scampi, which was perfectly cooked and gave a nice sized chunk of lobster meat. 

Finally, the desserts. The lemon cheesecake is both aesthetically and taste-wise a star. I would go back just for this. 
The sorbetto covered in cream was delicious as well. 

Overall, it is definitely a pricier meal, but it delivers!","{""Friends"":111,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/pFZIbhRQNW-4xTZBUC57ww/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Brooklyn, NY"",""Photos"":123,""Reviews_made"":209,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A-ed1j8lfnUpdlglwmfUnQ"",""Username"":""Bre Y.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/i7lb-r2nj7P8iLJtgqXyiA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RS4P71B3pKyXsKaZNnONRA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6UoW4kX_qDv5wFUqiQwFVA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Fnl3Hb4rQHljk55Gu-WWmQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/dZsVfxwnxfw57x6B0Q0mpQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y_MKAgMDudWKB2No67adCg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Bre,\nThank you for your kind words!

It was nice that it stayed warm in the heated pot it was brought in.  My husband also loved his pulled pork on brioche with mashed potatoes.

"larry-hopkins-honda-sunnyvale","""21/10/2017""",4,"My 2014 Honda Accord was acting up and I wasn't sure of the issue, so I contacted Larry Hopkins for help. Originally, my car was purchased at another Honda dealership, but Larry Hopkins Honda is a convenient location for me. Called in, front desk didn't sound too friendly - maybe it was a bad day for her. Routed my call to Rob Alvarado, an advisor who was not available to take calls so I decided to leave a voicemail. Assuming that I probably wouldn't get a call back til the end of the day or so, Rob contacted me back in a few hours which came to my surprise. He heard my concern and welcomed me to stop by to see him to get this issue resolved. My car battery died and I had it replaced, but there was still a ""Check Charge System"" error prompting on my car dash. The service that was done to my car was the complimentary multi-point inspection and the battery sensor recall. While I was at it, I told Rob I wanted to purchase wiper blades inserts. Rob took note of every detail and finished in a few hours which I thought I'd have to wait longer. Very friendly and helpful advisor who showed me how to replace the wiper blades inserts as well as having it installed for me. He also gave me a follow up call earlier today to check in how my car was and it shows the excellent service he provides.

"montage-deer-valley-park-city","""14/04/2017""",4,"The Montage wows on the wide tree-lined entrance perched above Park City. It's a beautiful property - the views are spectacular, the public spaces are expansive and luxurious, and the service was accommodating. I daresay, the rooms may be a touch above the nearby St. Regis in terms of luxury. It's blissful to sit outside on the balcony, sipping coffee, and soaking in the scenery. The hike from the front desk is worth it - the rooms feel isolated and quiet even if the hotel is sold-out. It's certainly a resort about getting away from it all.
Downstairs on the slopes, the ski valets take away the awful part of skiing - the schlepping and drying of the gear - and the ski-in/out location on Deer Valley Resort maximizes your time on the best resort in Park City. The après-ski cider, cookies, and marshmellow roast are special, thoughtful touches.

"missions-at-back-bay-costa-mesa-2","""07/12/2022""",1,"Awful place. Incompetent staff. 

Laundry area: Water on the floor from tenants squeezing out their clothes. Why? Because the spin cycle doesn't work on the laundry machines and hasn't for two years. Trash on the floor.

Outside area: Dog poop all over the place. People screaming in the middle of the night. Flies everywhere because of said dog poop and it smells awful.

Inside: Roaches roaches and more roaches. 

Staff: Besides the maintenance guy this is literally the worse staff I've ever seen, even when I lived in some shady spots as a young guy. You'd find better staff in the projects. They don't answer you. I notice they answer yelp reviews, but as you can see from the responses back that was only to the benefit of the viewer. They didn't actually get back to the tenant and resolve anything. I got shuffled back and forth between the email hotline and the text hotline six times. They didn't care about me at all. They just wanted to shove me off to their coworker, and that coworker shoved me back to them. 

I was fedup and sent an email to the district manager who also didn't answer.

I found a homeless person literally living out of my carport. I'm not kidding. One day I came to my car and this lady was getting dressed behind it, and all her stuff was in my carport cubby. She was angry that I told her she couldn't live out of it, saying other people wouldn't have a problem with her doing that. What??!

Cars are getting broken into. No surprise after the above discovery. 

Hidden fees. Don't believe the price. It's $400 more. It's not for utilities it's just random BS fees like processing fees or paying for your parking spot. 

This place is breathtaking in the incompetence and in surprisingly terrible shape for what they are trying to portray themselves as. They have accomplished one thing that's unique to Newport-Mesa and that is to have created the first slum in this area. 

I know one thing, I could never ever get away with this at my job. My clients would leave me quickly. I can't imagine how this place can stay in business, and upper management you need to take a hard look at what's being said consistently across the board.

PROS:
- Good sized menu but not overwhelming and lots of great choices! 
- Fantastic prices ($10 or less for almost all menu items)
- Flavorful food and not very greasy with the fried stuff
- Like a real diner, they have Greek options 
- Very clean
- Local, not touristy
- Big parking lot, but can get crowded as well
- Great place to bring your family

CONS:
- It's a small place so if you are heading over on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait and be patient
- No mimosas 

I have been here twice and both times were awesome. I've tried one of the breakfast combos and enjoyed the mini omelet this week. Grits are delicious and the biscuits are very tasty.

"solbar-calistoga","""20/04/2009""",4,"Had lunch after a relaxing morning at their spa.  We were a bit early for our lunch reservation so they let us lounge outside and order drinks.  I had the ""Flower Power"" which was a tasting of 3 white wines.  I may be allergic to all white wine because after each sip I'd sneeze.  There was a very diverse group of people there, from families with young children, twenty-somethings talking business and a retired elderly couple, my mom and I enjoyed people watching and chatting while sipping our drinks under the shade. 

I had a gift certificate for lunch for two.  It didn't say anything except gratuity and alcohol were not included.  We asked our server who was extremely polite and helpful for clarification.  Lunch for two means an appetizer and entree for each person, so we ordered the following:

Warm Baby Artichoke & Arugula Salad:  Delicious!  Although the ""crouton"" on top of the salad which was an olive tuile was not good.  I'm not a fan of olives in the first place, but it  didn't taste like olives, it just tasted a bit burned. 

Spicy Shrimp Lettuce Wraps:  I didn't think the shrimp was spicy at all, although my mom did.  So either I have a higher tolerance for heat, or the heat was unevenly distributed throughout the dish.  You don't construct these wraps yourself, the butter lettuce leaves come filled with noodles, avocado, pickled cucumbers and carrots (yum!) and topped with 1.5 pieces of shrimp.  The dipping sauce was yummy, it had some red pepper flakes, cilantro and fish sauce.  It was a very refreshing appetizer for a lovely, warm afternoon!  Oh, and this dish was definitely not appetizer sized, it was a pretty generous portion.  

Crispy Petrale Sole Fish Tacos:  Delicious.  The fish was fried to perfection.  The tortillas were fluffier than usual, which I liked.  These were definitely fork and knife tacos, you cannot wrap the tortilla around the 2-3 pieces of sole.  I felt like this dish needed beans and rice.

BBQ Beef Brisket:  Scrumptious!  It was an open faced sandwich on a ginormous piece of Texas Toast.  The perfectly toasted bread was topped with coleslaw, thinly sliced brisket, bbq sauce and fried onions.  Accompanying the sandwich were some really good bbq beans.  Totally had to box up half of this deliciousness. 

So lunch for two?  Ended up being around $90.  When I returned from the restroom my mom told me that all the drinks (including the alcohol) were covered!  Excellent :)  

While other yelpers think the service was slow, I thought it was reminiscent of all the meals I had last summer in Europe.  The service was fine and everyone was attentive and nice.  It's nice to not be rushed through a meal.  You're in a resort in the middle of one of the most beautiful valleys in the world.

I was adamant about eating at an actual store as opposed to a cart because I was worried carts wouldn't stock as many veggie dogs. The inside of the small store was very hot with no air circulation or AC, so that was a big con especially when on a hot summer day. Eating hot dogs in a sweaty, crowded restaurant is the last thing you want to do. But there are some limited seating right outside the store, and that is much better than sitting inside.

The hot dogs however, are wonderful and definitely do not disappoint. The hot & spicy dog was surprisingly spicy, and I can usually tolerate a high level of heat. The terimayo dog is always a safe way to go - has all the ingredients that supplement the hot dog very well. Highly recommend the terimayo dog for first timers!","{""Friends"":318,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/FOYIYRRSQQD_866qo2rWZQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Jose, CA"",""Photos"":133,""Reviews_made"":65,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LGgPvSxWUg_5pWNlZ3WnPQ"",""Username"":""Kelly L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/QRALsQFBbsqHuRTtOX7OPQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eVw5tkMNj7hMERZlEFQRQg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",210,"","0 check-in","Japadog"

"mikes-coffee-shop-brooklyn","""28/12/2017""",5,"Y'ALL. This is the ONLY place in all of Brooklyn that I've been able to get a Greek-American-style gyro. Growing up in Montgomery County, Maryland, there were tons of Greek restaurants and every one of them served gyros where the meat came in thinly sliced strips of lamb and beef. And, until now, I hadn't realized this was a Greek-American thing!

Many of the gyros I've tried in Brooklyn have chunks of meat that are sliced/shaved but, because they are skewered whole pieces of meat to begin with, they have a different texture/flavor. It's just more reminiscent of BBQ in texture and, often, that's a bit too tough for me. Plus, when I'm craving a gyro, I'm craving what I grew up eating and that's a Greek-American gyro! Side note: My boyfriend ended up discovering all of this because we were so confused as to why the gyros here were so different from what we grew up eating so he Googled it. The reason Greek-American gyros are so soft and flavorful through and through is because they ""are made with a large, sausage-like cone of seasoned minced lamb and beef."" (Thank you, Serious Eats, for the lesson! Haha!) 

SO - back to Mike's Coffee Shop. They have Greek-American gyros and they are perfect. Get the gyro platter because it comes with some delicious fries. The sauce and lettuce and tomato and onion was all perfect with just the right amount of each. And now I'm craving another one even though I literally just ate this like 2 days ago.

The waffles were PERFECTLY crispy and had a TON of blueberry flavor in them, without having actual chunks of blueberry. Maybe they pureed the blueberries into the batter? Either way, I preferred it this way, personally, because sometimes the moisture from blueberries can weigh down a good waffle and make it soggy. These were just super crispy and very blueberry-flavorful! The bacon was also good, cus it was bacon so duh.

"sydnee-rose-foot-spa-and-nail-salon-northridge","""28/08/2008""",4,"Okay, I meant to give up unnecessary indulgences such as pedicures...I really did.  This abstinence lasted for almost two months, especially after I got fed up with all the upselling and pushy nature of the technicians at my old favorite nail salon.  However, it is summer, and sometimes a girl just needs a little pampering after a stressful day at work.  

With this justification in mind, I called up Sydnee Rose Foot Spa & Nail Salon during my lunch break on Tuesday, and booked an appointment for that same day.  The customer service was just like that of day spas I've been to in the past.  Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted by name and shown around the facilities.  After settling into my massage chair with a cup of watermelon (or cucumber...it was some taste I couldn't discern) flavored water, the technician went to work on my kitten-heel-tortured feet.  Since there are two pedicure chairs per alcove, I had quite a bit of privacy, and the technician even turned off the lights when she could so I could snooze properly.  How awesome is that?!

The star treatment I received definitely puts this nail salon at the top of my list, but I was disappointed with the paltry selection of polishes.  Also, snoozing during pedicures is a risky thing to do; I ended up with square-shaped nails when I prefer my natural round shape.  For these reasons, this place gets 4 stars instead of 5.  Fairly pricey, but worth it for the rare indulgence.  I've added pics of the spa menu so fellow Yelpers get an idea of what to expect in terms of price.  Will update once I test to see whether the pedicure withstands three weeks like a proper pedicure should.

My friends and I tried Rocco's as it was a recommendation from my coworker. We came here on a busy Tuesday night and had to wait about 45 minutes. It wasn't too long and they also called us before our time was up. 

We got seated at a booth and quickly ordered some tacos and guac for the table. O-M-G. The tableside guac was AMAZING. So good, that we had to come back before our flight back to Boston. My boyfriend and I shared a couple tacos - crispy fish, carne asada, shrimp, and slow cooked pork (carnitas). Wow, I think they were all so delicious, but ranking from best to good, I'd say the fish, carne asada, shrimp, then carnitas. The margaritas were also really great as well. So great that I ordered THREE. 

The second time we came to Rocco's, we got the guac, margs, and also tried the molcajetes. SO delish!! It's their version of fajitas. It comes with tortillas so you can kinda make your own tacos out of them. 

I WILL be back!!

  Confused as to how the seating went, but manager saw us ready to leave and found us a spot. Our waiter rarely checked on us after we ordered our drinks. I had wanted to ask for some water, but , by the time I got it, our food finally came. We had no silverware to eat with, so  we nibbled with our fingers for 15 min until we got anyone's attention. It took another 10 min to get silverware. 
     Total experience was 1 hr 15 min
   We were with 2 teenaged grandchildren, anxious to get home, so frustration level was pretty high by the time we finally got our check. He knew we were upset with the service and wait, but never apologized, which would have helped. 
    The manager had stopped by once , right before our food came out and we complained about the wait.  It would have been nice if he had helped our waiter, who seemed overwhelmed.
  I would come again for the awesome food, but maybe for lunch or early dinner with just 2 of us.

"ken-towerys-tire-and-auto-care-louisville-10","""06/12/2020""",1,"Updating my review from 2 years ago. I just realized this specific location has a bad rating relative to the other locations. We used the location on Hurstbourne in the past and had great experiences. Not so much at this location. 

Echoing other reviewers, it's rare to go for an oil change and not leave needing more work done. Even if the work truly needs done, good luck getting it done correctly the first time. The past two visits we've been back and forth within the week to redo the fix that should've been done initially. Both times we were told ""that's weird, parts are faulty 2% of the time, so maybe that's it"".  Even with the affordability, it's not worth the hassle. 

Speaking of hassle, my wife has been checked out and made uncomfortable by the guys at the counter the last two visits. When I've been the one picking up the car, the check-out process has been slow and they even mixed up my keys once. No one at the counter has ever been wearing a mask (written during COVID). Generally, everything about this location has gone downhill from our initial experience. 

We're done here - I'd recommend looking elsewhere for car care, even if only to a different Ken Towery location.","{""Friends"":42,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/3LrlfiYiCqvtRx-sNBQrDQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Houston, TX"",""Photos"":76,""Reviews_made"":141,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1_zhh3euFm4Yw-AZfH1NqQ"",""Username"":""Matt B.""}","null","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""We're sorry that we failed to deliver the service you deserve.

I was reading most of the recent reviews on the car ride there and scared both of us considering there were quite a few food poisonings. To be honest, my stomach was in knots as we arrived because I knew my stomach is pretty weak.

We were greeted by this pleasant woman who seated us immediately. We both ordered the chasu tsukemen (pork dipping ramen) to see what the hype was about. Just a fair warning, the soup is not really drinkable - it's a lot thicker than normal ramen broth. The noodles were delicious however - kinda hard, but still soft enough to enjoy. They cut their chasu pieces here thickly with little to no fat on them (yes!). Lime is also served with your meal as well as a perfectly-cooked egg. The yolk of the egg is oddly sweet however. Was not really a fan of this. It was a little anticlimactic having to dip the noodles into cold broth as it takes some time to finish your meal.

The customer service here was very friendly and accommodating. The food wasn't bad at all (no signs of upset stomach just yet), but I'm not a fan of the tsukemen fad.","{""Friends"":579,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/NCvGNUfYXQgS7tC5GBSP6w/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Jose, CA"",""Photos"":629,""Reviews_made"":600,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1J2zVswrcASag0M34sVsFw"",""Username"":""Joanne Y.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/h7Up4RFlYVkZUQNZRZNVAQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":5,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",1404,"","0 check-in","Tsujita LA Artisan Noodle"

"memories-of-india-lake-mary","""20/06/2017""",5,"Came here for lunch with a small party. They have reasonably priced lunches ranging from $9-10 and there is a AAA discount if you happen to be a member.  I believe it knocks off 10% of your bill. For lunch there is an option to add on a samosa for an extra $1.50, which is well worth it in my opinion. 

I purchased the chicken vindaloo lunch and it came out with a dude of rice, several different spices, chips, as well as a portion of naan. The food was cooked perfectly and tasted authentic as far as I can tell in my limited experience with Indian food.

I still think the food and wine and selection is amazing, and you can hopefully see my last review for suggestions. It is a top notch, classy place for friends or an important outing! 

Unfortunately I don't feel like my friends and I got the respect we deserved when we visited in January. Given, the restaurant was very crowded, our server took our order and left us in the dust. The part that gets me is that he actively checked on all tables around our table - who were older adults (we are all 22 and look very young). It had me feeling that it was age related, maybe he didn't think he would get a good tip from younger adults? (I am a good tipper, over 20% if decent service) Because he was flying by, when we did try to get his attention he got our wine order wrong because he gave us two seconds (literally) to spout out our orders.

I will probably be back, but hopefully we get checked on and aren't left with empty glasses for twenty minutes!","{""Friends"":263,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/C-KX6GNqemdQ7SBG8KCS-Q/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Overland Park, KS"",""Photos"":91,""Reviews_made"":41,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MXvprr3aLH9JwSpexvOpiw"",""Username"":""Steph R.""}","null","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""I visited Louie's for the first time a month ago when I took my mom out for her birthday.

First impression: it SEEMED like a pleasant idea at first. The atmosphere was upbeat and it wasn't crowded. There was one only one female bartender which was adequate since there was no crowd. The problem was she seemed pretty preoccupied with her friends at the end of the bar. I sat for 10 minutes before she sauntered over and asked me if Id like to see a menu. No personality. Not a good look for a hungry brother just getting off of work.. Luckily a regular sat next to me and she flew over to attend to him. Then she pepped up and her service seemed to magically improve.

Boyfriend and I went for a lunch date. Made a reservation but that didn't matter. We ended up sitting inside because we were pretty hungry and thought 'why not?', first mistake. It was super loud and unruly due to no one else sitting inside but I do take the fault on that.

I ask the server what their suggestion would be and I am told everything is good but the wrap is one of their favorite items. So I order that and holy hell.. there is no flavor at all but heat. I had my boyfriend try it too and he agreed.

Boyfriend got the rockefeller salad which was good but super small. The rockefeller burger that was REPULSIVE! There was seriously half a tomato, raw, just chilling on it.. He also got a lemonade which was only lime juice, f***ing sick. We were doomed from the start. We told the server about our drink and asked for a diet coke instead. NGL, I assumed they would have been decent and not charged for the d coke but whatever, ya know.

No one came by to ask how our food was. 

Shit service, shit food, shit atmosphere.

Do not recommend unless you seriously dont give a f***.

Prices were great as well, especially for the portion of food that was handed out. Parking can be a tad rough in this area if the local garage is packed, which leaves you to street parking, just an FYI.

As mentioned above, went with the standard German ratio of food, yet it did not disappoint, I really wish I could elaborate on the beer, but I have already forgotten the exact names of them. As for the ambiance, it definitely made me feel like I was in a small cliche German beer garden, but was not overdone by any means, very relaxed feel overall.

I love chicken & waffles but I also love French toast. Thought I'd mix it up and ordered the Chicken French toast and it was underwhelming :'( 
It was sitting in a savoury sauce, the maple bourbon bbq glaze. I just wish maybe the sauce was on the side so the bread and chicken wouldn't get soggy throughout the meal. It said it would've been topped with hot honey (was super excited for this!) but I didn't find enough of it was on, they also did not offer any syrup on the side. 
The fried chicken itself was ok but very thin. 
HUGE portions though, so if you're hungry, it's a plus.

My fiancé got the Old town breakfast, the sausages had a very strong rosemary taste to them and the egg whites itself were still quite runny.

He looked around at my custom Koa furniture and told me he would personalize the packing for our special pieces. Larry offered his guys to help my family finishing overall packing because he observed we were coming close to our date. 
Hire Larry and his crew, give them time to take a look, and relax. They take apart your big items as needed (beds and such) and out them back together no problem.
They place all your large items as requested, they are kind, courteous, clean and professional.
100% true review, they are all you need to move, excellent service, and a reasonable cost.
5 times, over 12 years, and they only get better and better!
Larry, thank you Sir! You and your guys ROCK!

Finally when we got to order she seemed great, when we got our orders she mixed them up. Everyone got different plate and she forgot to check in on us at least to see if we needed more drinks. Also the coffee tasted weak or like I say in Spanish ""agua de calcetín.""

Of course she shows up for the bill with the added gratuity and disappears again! By this time I want to minus the $22 tip and even contemplated dining and dashing, pretty sure they wouldn't notice.

"mikes-coffee-shop-brooklyn","""25/08/2013""",4,"We arrived at around 1 on a beautiful Sunday. A nice older gentleman (Mike?) took our name and party size and told us there would be a 10-15 minute wait, which was pretty accurate- we waited outside for about 10 minutes before being called in. There's really no room to wait inside, so I don't know how this is all worked out in the winter. The restaurant itself just looks like a regular diner and has a bit of a throwback vibe. There were indeed lots of people here after church in their Sunday bests, dudes rocking suits... but the crowd is as eclectic as the neighborhood. People dressed up, people dressed down... we didn't feel out of place in our shorts and tshirts.

The menu consists of pretty standard diner food. I ordered a delish iced coffee and, due to Yelp popularity, the chicken and waffles. Now, in the past, I haven't gotten too excited about the prospect of chicken and waffles, as I'm not a super huge fan of either fried chicken or waffles separately. But, guys, this dish was awesome. The chicken was tender and a little sweet itself and went perfectly with the fluffy, buttery waffle and some maple syrup to top it all off. The chicken was served on a separate plate, which was a little different, so I just transferred it all onto one plate. My friend ordered OJ, hot tea, french toast topped with cinnamon sugar, and also a side of scrambled eggs. I didn't try any of this, but she said the eggs were done perfectly, and she liked the french toast as well.

We were kind of in a rush so we didn't quite have time to finish the big portions, and asked for a box to go. Our waiter, who was really sweet, quickly rounded up the check, the boxes, plastic utensils and even some little to-go syrups. Aw.

To be fair we didn't say anything because the server was attentive and we figured restaurants were having trouble finding good staff and the bad food is a result of lack of staff.  We all reflected that if the food cost 1/3 of the price we would have said, 'well, it's cheap and cheerful'.  Instead, we all agreed, 'that was crap and not worth the price point.'

The 2 main dentists are sisters: Phuong Trinh and Phuong Thao. A little bit of advice, if you can't really handle pain and have sensitive teeth, I would suggest you recommend Thao because Trinh does your teeth cleaning with a little more..power. I can feel my teeth being very clean and roots a little swollen from all the cleaning and prodding after Trinh works on my teeth but Thao does it in with more ease and a soft touch. When I was younger, I would always want Thao to clean my teeth but now, I can handle a little more pain so I don't mind if Trinh cleans my teeth. Both dentists are great!

The staff are all very friendly, too. They speak Eng, Viet, and Cambodian. If you don't have insurance, I believe it's $60 for basic teeth cleaning.

"the-fatty-patty-west-allis-west-allis","""26/06/2024""",1,"Very disappointed with my visit today, and quite frankly, very surprised that this place has a 4.5.

I had the fire ring burger, and here was my problem with it.  Nothing was fresh, and everything was frozen and I can make a similar burger at home

1) the onion ring was clearly a frozen onion, and inedible.  The batter was dry, crumbly, old, and the onion was also old and I couldn't even bite through it... I had to remove it entirely from the sandwich

2. The burger was clearly frozen and dried out... They didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked. Bad sign.... But it was definitely cooked through well done... It really had a strange texture.  I didn't finish it

3. Swiss cheese.  It only covered 1/2 of the burger. Very sad

4. Other burger toppings. Pickles jalapenos were most likely from a jar or can.  Here's a suggestion: use fresh pickles and jalapenos, it will make a difference.  There was also only two small pieces of lettuce on the bottom w the siracha mayo

5. The fries and soda meal combo is NOT worth $4 because the seasoned fries are clearly from the frozen food section of the grocery store. Very sad. Underwhelming

6. The bun was also not fresh... It's obvious... Here's a suggestion, go to Wedl's hamburger stand in Jefferson and you will learn a thing or two.

Also, very disappointed with the lack of seating (there is none, unless you want to endure the 100 degree indoor barstool seats. Only one table outside.  Also disappointed with the owner/manager being on his phone instead of helping me and making me wait... Didn't seem interested in providing ANY type of friendly customer service. Not ok.

To my surprise you made a comment that Culver's is better, yet they have gotten quite few 1-star reviews from you. It seems to me that the problem may be in the customer not the restaurant.\n\nOur number one priority is to always provide the best service and food quality with every order. Therefore, I would like to address the issues you brought up. \n\n#1-we do not advertise that our onion rings are fresh made in-house, we purchase the top quality ready made onion rings, we would NEVER sell or serve anything (as you described) as being \""old.\""  \n\n#2-our burger meat is made fresh everyday IN-HOUSE NEVER frozen. \n\n#3-the swiss-cheese that you are stating only covered 1/2 the burger, is melted cheese, and maybe to your eyes could have been mistaken as a 1/2 portion. \n\n#4-we choose our toppings to be pickled jalapeño and if you don't like pickled jalapeños you could have just asked without it. And your suggestion to use fresh pickles does not make sense since all pickles are pickled in jar, unless you want cucumbers. \n\n#5- I'm truly upset with this comment because in the end I gave you the drink and fries for free, as an appreciation for your service, which I guess was a mistake on my end. So you truly didn't pay the extra $4, which is an AMAZING deal for a combo! \nIn the end, the burger you ordered is $8.00 and if someone would like to make it a combo $4.00 extra, which makes the meal price at $12.00 (without tax), just the same as the restaurants you stated (Culver's, Wendy's, etc...) by the way, never do these restaurants give you fresh quality food. \n\n#6- our buns are ALWAYS fresh and of top quality, we are NOT A BAKERY, but we make sure our vendor gives us the best buns! \n\nLastly, our restaurant is clearly stated on menu AND on google that we are a take-out restaurant ONLY. Therefore, the seats that we have available are just for waiting if our customers don't want to stand on their feet. And of course it is summer and temperature is rising everywhere, we have no control over that.  \n\nAlso, please when you make a comment like this regarding the owner/manager being on his phone, also make note that he had answered the phone to another CUSTOMER and stated to please hold until he was able to get your order. \n\nThank you, and if you have any questions or comments please feel free to give me a call at- (773-732-1170)"",""Date"":""26/06/2024"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/5JzsaRaXl_9BGK0eYNRyKA/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Ali A.""}]",10,"","0 check-in","The Fatty Patty-West Allis"

"groton-wellness-groton-2","""21/04/2019""",1,"Dental Practice: ""Wealthcare not Healthcare."" Do not recommend owner J Norton. Had to have my family Dentist fix her work, sloppy, poor communication, & unpleasant, impatient bedside manner.  Read the biological dentistry book while waiting and they did not follow the recommendations or procedures as I understood from that book and my research.  Very rushed appointments except when they are trying to sell you another expensive service.  Saw one other dentist who was adequate but did not have enough time to properly fix the issue even though I had 4 hours of travel invested in the day plus the 8 hours for the prior 2 appointments.  I left there saying the apparatus was causing severe pain and their schedule was more important.  Lost a good amount of money because they wouldn't take it back and refund me.  They are trying to help by taking insurance, but they make up for the lower cost by skimping on the quality and time spent.  She also tried to jam too much in one appointment and made a mess in my mouth.  Coerced me into a filling in between my teeth that did NOT need to be filled and it bothered me for a long time because she overfilled.  Got filling material all over my teeth- front, side, and back and in multiple places.
Hygenist was caring and that was an excellent cleaning experience with the warm lavender pillow and helpful information.  The place is spa like, but also pretty out of the way in the middle of nowhere, and a pain to get to off the highway.  If you are close by, they take your insurance as in network, you have time and money to blow, and select the right dentist this might be worth a try.  Start with simple things until you really get to know the dentist is right for you.  Travelling a good distance for this place I would not recommend because of their inconsistency in the quality and process of dental and health care as other reviews have pointed out.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""Newport, RI"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":79,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jQtio_3BXT6855jR7yjPUQ"",""Username"":""No D.""}","null","[{""Number"":5,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hello No, We are sorry our business practices did not meet your expectations, and we appreciate you sharing your feedback.

Thank you.)
Hi Harry,
Thanks for your response. I was there at 2 PM or so, told the server that I just wanted fried shrimp and fries, plus garlic bread (didn't prefer the cornbread, but was aware I'd probably have to pay for it). I also had a Pepsi/Coke.  The portions were HUGE, so perhaps I was served the dinner meal.  I must admit, I didn't search the menu to find it.  I don't recall if I have my receipt, but it was the afternoon (early) of the 20th.  
Thank you. I appreciate your prompt inquiry very much.

PS: as noted, I also had the beignets.
Perhaps I'm too trusting, and I left it in the hands of the server.

The music was so loud that we couldn't hear each other. 4) they were out of silverware!! We had to use plastic utensils. 5)The food was trash!! Only a 3rd of our calamari was calamari. The other portion was friend peppers. We both got pink lemonades. It was Minute Maid lemonade with strawberry grenadine. I got the salmons and my friend got the fried chicken. Big mistake. The salmon taste freezer burnt. My rice was oily. My friend chicken looked like a pork chop and she said it tasted like chicken and pork. Smh. Her my n cheese was swimming in oil.

The place is not very modern, or fancy, but they make one hell of a bagel. I'm a self-proclaimed bagel enthusiast. I have had everything bagels from various vendors, good ones, bad ones, but this is definitely on the top of the pyramid. The bagel was very soft and was well toasted. My only issue was they put a lot of butter and when I went to eat it, butter was all over my hands.

As I waited to place my order, they were handing out samples of baked salmon, that too was pretty good. However, the staff doesn't seem to friendly, not rude, but just not overly enthusiastic about the job. I would love to come back here, but in the words of Kevin Hart, ""the way my patience is set up.......""

The crust on the chicken was out of this world and the meat was incredibly tender.  We've had the beans before and they are sooo good - I think at least 3 if not 4 different types and not too sweet.  The potatoes could have been a little warmer and it would be nice if they came with a little pat of butter but I guess I could have asked for that.  We also each got a gourmet soda - these could have been topped off a little better.  Pour it to the rim please :)  I'm giving 4 stars because as other reviewers have mentioned, consistency in the food is an issue some times.  I've had the brisket and been very disappointed in that it was pretty dry and the portion size was tiny for the price ($22).

The corned beef wasn't too salty, there was a lot of meat on the sandwich, there wasn't an overpowering flavor of thousand island dressing, and the sauerkraut complemented all the other components perfectly.

Warm field mushroom and goat cheese crepe, pine nut and parsley pesto, arugula and warm pickled chanterelles. The description sounds fresh and plentiful.

"sydnee-rose-foot-spa-and-nail-salon-northridge","""07/02/2018""",5,"I've been a customer here since 2010 after a co-worker told me about this local's secret. It's a gem - tucked away in a small strip mall off Reseda near the CSUN campus. I've never swayed from this place and boy, I struck gold when my first appointment was with Holly.  She consistently delivers quality work with quality products in a timely manner. 

Appointments for customers are usually on time - unless a customer runs in late, creating a domino effect to all others following that person. But nonetheless, Holly is so aware of her customers' time that she knows how to deliver. I consistently receive ah-mazing compliments, and peace of mind that my nails can last up to three weeks (regular fill).  She does gel as well along with pedicures too. Did you come across a picture on the web or in a magazine that you want to mimic? Show it to Holly and you too can have that look. Nail art from colors to embellishments is one of her gifts - live life and try something different each time. She's great with pink and white (I'd vote the best ever) - which I'll do for special occasions. The selection of brands and colors (the choices are nearly endless and the polishes are always new - none that refill racket I've seen elsewhere) is far the best I've seen anywhere: Essie, Orly, OPI, and more.  

A regular fill with Holly is $20. The cost has been the same price since my first appointment. Most places are charging more, and rarely do they go the extra mile that Holly does. I recommend a cash tip with each visit even if you charge the place for your appointment; let Holly know her craft is appreciated.

I'm writing the review and after all these years for two reasons: 1) Sharing this information could make my own future appointments with HOLLY tougher with the volume of customers she well deserves (hey, we all get selfish at some point, right?!), and 2) lots of my friends are making 2018 resolutions for a new 'go to' nail salon (they're tired of poor service, cheap product, long waits, inconvenient parking, high prices and that additional credit card fee...um no credit card fee here!). 

So as you look at my nails, it's not just another picture of great looking nails. It's knowing I have 3 whole weeks of really well done, strong and great looking nails (with just a regular fill) that can withstand everyday wear and tear, and look as good on the 21st day as they do on day 1. That's a rarity - just call and ask what fill powder the others are using...and you'll learn very quickly this place only uses the best.  Enjoy!

"aiyara-thai-cuisine-temecula","""19/03/2018""",2,"After eating here for years, I'm so disappointed in the changes the new owners have made. The menu has a much smaller selection, the food was so different in flavor, and the cook must be afraid to add spice heat to the dishes. 

We met another couple here for dinner this past week.
The scale for spiciness is mild, medium, hot. We ordered the Pork in Red Curry sauce (medium), Panang Curry with vegetables (mild), Pad Thai with Shrimp, Drunken Noodles with Chicken (mild), Stir Fry Vegetables, Brown rice, Thai Iced Tea and Thai Iced Coffee. 

We could not tell the difference in spiciness from the mild to the medium dishes. Overall, the dishes lacked the complexity and depth of flavor of the past. The Pad Thai was sweeter than before, ugh! I do not like sweet Pad Thai, and while this was not as sweet as Zabber's Pad Thai, it was still sweet. :(

After reading the owners response to a poor review, I can't help but add that the take out containers for liquids are, in fact, styrofoam, not the sturdy reusable plastic containers with very tight fitting lids as before. And also, the traditional Chinese takeout containers (without the handle so they can be microwaved) for the drier dishes.

The prices have definitely increased. I'm so bummed I did not take photos of all of the food this last time, but we were so hungry by the time it arrived, I forgot. And while I never measured the quantity served before or now, I can say from the photos of the last red curry verses the old panang vegetables the serving appear smaller now. And we did not have as much left over as we did in the past. Just say'n.

Finally, after seeing the response from the owner to the reviewer (Dan B.), I cannot give this place another try (as I had planned). Wow! 
Overall, it was a huge disappointment, and even more so, now. I'll be checking out other local Thai restaurants now in search of a replacement for Aiyara. :'(

Their seasoning does not tend to the sweet side as many Asian establishments do. \nThe Volcano is still one of our favorites, and the Aiyara Lagoon is excellent, as well. However, I wish the Lagoon had the option for the fish to grilled instead of deep fried. \nThe drunken noodles (medium heat) are a treat!\nThe various curries are distinct, creamy and well spiced. \nFor the same level of spice (medium) I find the noodle dishes hotter than the curry dishes (perhaps because the curries have coconut milk?). At any rate, be aware of that distinction. \n\nAlso, I feel this restaurant serves to American heat levels, not Thai levels, meaning I can handle medium here just like I can handle most medium salsas. But the more \""authentic\"" Thai restaurants tend to season everything crazy hot! One time I asked what level heat my soup was in a restaurant in Las Vegas. I asked because I thought it must be like a 6-7. The lady told me that had no heat!!! Yeah, a zero! Haha.\nBut here at Aiyara, they are reasonable with their heat :) and still have super delicious food with a beautiful setting, too (that's kind of rare for most Thai restaurants). \n\nWe have taken business associates from out of town to Aiyara and they always love it. We also like it for a date night. In short: excellent food and a wonderful atmosphere make this a great \""go to\"" spot for most any nice occasion.

First off, one if the valet men held our door open for us once we came into view. We walk down the mini staircase to be greeted by the receptionist who found our reservation via Yelp with no problem. 
We were then seated at the lounge tables (which I thought were the main dining tables) and was immediately offered drinks and appetizers. After a short wait, we were seated by the staff. And let me take this time to say that their customer service is just downright impeccable! Every single one! 
And now, the food. We had our complimentary bread and butter served right away. After ordering, we only waited a good 15mins max until our food came out -- cooked to absolute perfection! Yes, they're quite pricey, but the serving sizes were fair. Throughout our dinner, we would constantly have different staff checking up on us in a non-annoying way, very brief but enough to show care.
The atmosphere was very romantic, clean, not intimidating, business casual, not too loud, not too quiet. Simply, perfect.
So I guess it goes without saying that I find this place to be soooo wonderful. By far the best date place Ive been to. Ill definitely be coming back!","{""Friends"":1,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ZQbQdFHTl4uPN3le6NKddw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""San Diego, CA"",""Photos"":16,""Reviews_made"":37,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jJPXpDBbrQ_An2MQO5ItIQ"",""Username"":""Armie P.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UWdnhucWWAsWZGCtkt-DTg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zrY32Qforcq5E43DQIZK1A/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",1404,"","0 check-in","The Marine Room"

Unfortunately, it's a no go for me but it is only my first try. The appearance of my meal was not very inviting and it pretty tastes the way it looks. It didnt help that it was cold but I am not holding them responsible for that being that I ordered via 3rd party delivery. I have to consider the travel time as well. Perhaps, my expectations were a bit higher being that I paid almost $20 basically for a hot dog and potato tots.

The food was easily five stars.  At our table we ordered the cauliflower soup and various salads to start.  The cauliflower was a wonderful veloute with a garlic crouton on top.  It went down easily and fast. The salads were a hit, too.\n\nFor dinner at our table we ordered coq au vin, the herb gnocchi with vegetables and the Brasserie burger.  All of them were fantastic!  Just delicious, scrumptious, wonderful food.  The herb gnocchi were different but a lovely, light spring dish.  The coq au vin was tender and the sauce had a wonderful depth of flavor.  The brasserie burger was enjoyed, and the super thin frites were addictive. \n\nFor dessert we had the profiteroles, the lemon meringue cake and the chocolate coffee tart with burnt orange ice cream.  Perhaps my favorite flavor combination of all time is orange and dark chocolate, so I was in dessert heaven eating that tart.  The lemon meringue cake came with a very intriguing thyme ice cream that was a great compliment to the cake.  Finally, the classic profiteroles came with the best chocolate sauce I've ever tasted.  If you like cream puffs, these are not to be missed.\n\nThe service was fine, but nothing spectacular.  Brasserie seems to be suffering a bit from its own popularity.  We couldn't get a table until 8:15, even though reservations were made about 10 days in advance (who knew it was so hard to get a table in St Louis these days?!).  Our dinner stretched on for almost three hours because of the great delay between courses.  I'm all for a leisurely evening, but this place was packed to the rafters.  I imagine the kitchen gets quite hectic on Saturday nights.  There were people being seated for dinner at 10:30 (!).  If I hadn't known better, I would thought I was in NYC or Paris, instead of the CWE. Also, the noise level was deafening due to the number of diners and the lack of any sort of sound muffling decor.  \n\nOverall though, Brasserie is still a great meal and a wonderful high end dining experience for a fair price in a not-very-stuffy atmosphere.  This is still one of my favorites in STL.  Next time, though, I'll call far ahead and try to go on a week night to avoid the crowds!"",""Date"":""17/04/2011"",""Images"":[],""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/urJI0XoznCBpOnSQr2fjgg/60s.jpg"",""Username"":""Jessica C.""}]",504,"","0 check-in","Brasserie by Niche"

"sweet-hut-bakery-and-cafe-doraville","""12/03/2015""",1,"A very good friend raved about Sweet Hut Bakery and highly recommend it since I can survive just on sweet pastries for my meal. I know my review may anger many fellow yelpers and hopefully there would be not be any protest, be it violent or peaceful ones.

Sweet Hut's pastries are awful. Sorry, they were really awful. I never comprehend why people love them. I bought a few of them after my friend and fellow yelpers raved about Sweet Hut. That was before Paris Baguette had opened near the vicinity. 

The place was rather packed if I did not remember wrongly. The lighting was not the brightest. I looked at those cakes displayed in the case, they looked so unappetizing. I thought whatever I bought could not be that bad. I couldn't been so wrong. 

When I got into the car, I took a look at the pastries, the egg tart looked sad. It looked better in the store but not under direct sunlight. Fine, looks could be deceiving or was it? The egg tart was disappointing to say the least. Ok, how about those bread?

The quality of the bread was not even close to that of White Windmill and even far from those from Paris Baguette. I FaceTime my mom and I showed her one of the bread, I asked her to tell me what was wrong. She said the quality of the flour was not top grade. Thank you very much, Mom.

To be fair, some people said the bubble tea is good there, I never try it so I could not comment on it. It probably is but I would not get to know since there is no way I will make my way there to buy another mediocre pastry. If someone asked me there must be one positive quality of Sweet Hut, I would say the only thing I could think of was the prices, they were cheap and I could see why.","{""Friends"":161,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/fCQuqvnBxnneLqEl7F4vuA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Atlanta, GA"",""Photos"":4726,""Reviews_made"":657,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0V_C2aOTDKuR8CO3P3RvJw"",""Username"":""Theresa H.""}","null","[{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",310,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Sweet Hut Bakery & Cafe"

"jam-cafe-victoria","""27/06/2022""",4,"Oh my goodness, Jam Café is popular.  It's THE spot for breakfast in Victoria, so expect to wait in line if you don't show up the first one there.  But who doesn't want to sleep in?  And honestly, I think you should just sleep in.

We attempted to visit Jam Café on a Sunday for breakfast and the line was way too long.  I got things to do, yo!  But we ended up coming back the following day, a Monday, which was much better.  We arrived around 9am and were able to be seated inside immediately, even though we were hoping for a table outside.  But those were all taken by the early risers!  By the time we left there was a line outside of peeps, waiting to brunch.  Holy moly. 

Is it worth the wait is what you're asking, right?  Well, no, I don't think so.  I was glad we visited when we didn't have to wait because I am not sure if I would've waited an hour or so for the gravy coops, the dish I ordered.  Don't get me wrong - it's a tasty dish.  But is it the best brunch I've ever had?  No.  

I ordered the gravy coops, which was a fried chicken on a biscuit with two over easy eggs, sausage gravy and hashbrowns.  My partner ordered the special of the day, the carne asada and eggs dish with cornbread.  It didn't take too long to get our food, and we both enjoyed what we had.  My dish was heavy, as if you didn't get that hint by reading the description.  The fried chicken was good and tender.  I did like how flaky and soft the biscuit was, but surprisingly, the gravy was a little bland.  I chose the sausage gravy and couldn't really taste much of that rich, sausage flavor that you usually get from this kind of gravy.  But they make their own hot sauce, so I definitely topped my dish with that, which added some flavor.  My partner also liked his dish, but mentioned he wouldn't order it again.  

Overall, if you find yourself looking for a brunch spot in Victoria, I'm sure Yelp and other search engines will tell you about Jam Café because they do offer a wonderful array of traditional brunch items, savory and sweet.  But I don't think you should wait an hour for it.  Wake up early or visit on an off-peak time and you'll be happy you dined here.","{""Friends"":114,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/WvU2RQ6ER1ADqUheCzBMaQ/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Bellevue, WA"",""Photos"":6260,""Reviews_made"":3268,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YQ01_0vr9TahbQiBSr69Nw"",""Username"":""Jacques I.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iNgrDjdIFZs-agh_tvJLKw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",5,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Jam Cafe"

"autobody-denton-carstar-denton-2","""03/10/2023""",5,"Cross-posted on Google Reviews too. I've had two of my cars painted by Carstars. They are GREAT!

September 2023 (2nd review)
Carstars does it again! Special thanks to Matt and TJ (I learned the name of the painter) for repairing and repainting my  new-to--me BMW 330i ZHP just right!  Not two days after I bought this beauty from a friend, some low-life POS here in Denton keyed it. But since I needed a front bumper repaint and a dent fix on another door, it just got done all at the same time.

Just like my front end repaint of my 1998 4Runner (below), Mat was willing to work with me on lowering my out of pocket cost as much as possible by allowing me to remove body parts to allow me to save on labor and reinstallation costs that the shop would charge. This actually allowed me to remove the black door and front bumper protection parts (black strips) and recondition them with a graphene-type black coating.  Just like last time, Mats and crew did a solid job. I opted not to blend the rear passenger door panel to save a grand or so and they still did an excellent paint match! The key scratches along the passenger door are all gone as is the dent that the previous owner's wife put in it. Also, I had Mats and team paint the front bumper as it was faded pretty bad, and lastly there were a bunch of white door dings caused again by the PO's wife. Oh, the shop also does mechanic work. They fixed the rear passenger door's window regulator and now the window works as it should.

The car looks AMAZING. She'll be a garage queen for sure for now and I have a bunch of little things I need to do to get it perfect. But again, the paint job is fantastic, the service was great, and the communications by all parties kept me informed and happy.

Thanks again for the second time in a year, Carstars!

******  PREVIOUS REVIEW ****

I had a great experience w/ the team at Denton Carstar and special thanks to Mats, who clearly understood that I was wanting to save as much money as possible but still want a quality paint job at the end. My beloved 1998 4Runner (owned since 2000) spent most of its life in CA and has been one of the best vehicles I've owned and has taken me to far off places but has reliably performed on the day-to-day stuff that life threw at me. Needless to say though at 275K miles, I didn't want to break the bank getting it painted. I called about 7 different places and 5 of them never returned calls so I went to Carstars because it was close to my work place. Mats understood that I am a car guy and take pride in this vehicle. He allowed me to remove some exterior parts that I knew how to do to save on money, and I really appreciated that. From there, he and the crew there turned my vehicle over to me in about 8-9 days.  The paint looks great! Oh, the prior paint job from an autobody place in CA had delaminated at the 10 year mark as they said it would, so this was a repaint. Anyways back to the paint job, I don't see a single flaw and I hope it lasts as long as they say it will. So far so good, no complaints. Highly recommend that you talk with Mats!

I've attached a bunch of before and after shots though the after shots do not have the fender flares and the antenna back on as I'm waiting for parts.","{""Friends"":560,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/SroRGJ72Ak0ZIytt4heQGA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Denton, TX"",""Photos"":2963,""Reviews_made"":749,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wphq2ZRlC4XHzETQvjDjmQ"",""Username"":""Bob K.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PtXGu3gGEscD4kq0clcY1Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vuQQvnHyslQGfhRjIdE1TA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-sUczcY7MRsXQ1-Um3dFJg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/hbOTgdnBlc4RwWQUvtLKRA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",3,"","0 check-in","Autobody Denton CARSTAR"

We made the drive down on a Saturday at 1pm and it wasn't too crowded. The cashier helped with recommendations and our waffles were brought out to us pretty quickly. I ordered the Monte Cristo, my boyfriend got Zac's Mac, and we split a scoop of banana pudding ice cream.

My monte cristo was the perfect temperature and I really liked everything other than the waffle. It was just too dense and doughy inside for me. I've had other liege waffles that were lighter and flakier and that's what I was expecting. They were also less sweet and really only had sweetness from the sugar crystals on the outside. Seems like the dough itself has a lot of sugar at Seabrook. I didn't think the waffle tasted good with the Mac and cheese, but my boyfriend liked it!

At the time, Madison Bar and Grill had an opening for a table of 5, which saved us from sitting in the cold. We were very happy that we came across this place and would recommend it to anybody in the area for brunch.

Service:
- very knowledgeable and courteous staff. 
- as mentioned above, we walked in and got a table of 5 in seconds
- food and drinks came out very quickly
- everyone is following COVID protocols
- we actually received a set of dirty utensils, which was no fun to see. 

Food:
- you have to try the Mac and cheese bites. They were perfect on a cold winter day.
- the French Onion Dumplings were unique. It had a lot of cheese and a lot of onion. Still tasted good overall and nice to share between multiple people
- the omelette is hefty and tastes great. I got it with the goat cheese because that's my favorite. 
- the veggie panini was a little underwhelming. Would not recommend. 
- the Bellinis are better tasting than the Mimosas 
- on the more expensive side for brunch. But it is Hoboken. 


Ambience:
- loved the exposed pipes in the ceilings
- vibrant Christmas decorations 
- we came on a Sunday, so they had multiple NFL games playing, perfect for me.","{""Friends"":20,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/pPU5fH97lHSh8fhDpEgFSA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Stony Brook, NY"",""Photos"":172,""Reviews_made"":155,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dv4qZSuKlUL4YuVQ6i4vCQ"",""Username"":""Darshak V.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/I2bEMlqq9TnsyeWGXnbCuw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PEBJXa9j6_xbHBwFP5RfHg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IxmRP3gBL-3et0Oti3Lhbw/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",9,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","The Madison Bar & Grill"

My Dad and Husband (the honorary guests due to Fathers day and my Dads birthday) LOVED IT. The parking is substantial (and free), theres also a trail nearby you can walk or rent a bike to use. 
The food was delicious! My husband and Dad got the burger and I got the breakfast sandwich. We were all EXTREMELY IMPRESSED and loved our meals. We also shared a peach cobbler- it had such great flavor. I just wish it had more ""crust"" as thats my favorite part of cobbler. Our server was also PHENOMENAL and so sweet to our child. We really liked her! I felt the price was reasonable for what we got. My only complaint is that we were automatically sat outside with the reservation (it didn't have a part to choose) and we weren't asked and it was hot!!! We still had a great time and the umbrella blocking the sun definitely helped.

"borneo-eatery-alhambra-2","""18/01/2017""",3,"My family and I wanted to try this restaurant because my aunt grew up in Singapore and was craving authentic Malaysian food. I grew up hearing stories about how yummy the food is in Singapore... how her favorite aunt would always make beef curry and how the fruits were fresh off the tree and so sweet (jackfruit, mangosteen, rambutan, even durian!).

Anyway, so we went here - a party of 4 - and boy were we hungry! We were seated right away. It looked like they had only one server (male) and one runner (a woman that didn't seem to speak English). The server was really helpful and patient with us. They have so many things on their menu and he helped us navigate. I knew from the other Yelp reviews that I definitely wanted to try the Roti and Chicken Satay. We also ordered the Oxtail, but the server forgot to add it to our order and by the time we realized we hadn't received it yet, we were all too full.

So here is what we ordered. Obviously the names are not the exact as they are on the menu, but enough so you can tell what something is. There are pictures to go along, too.

First up - the Roti. It was like a thin, crisp tortilla. It came with 2 large pieces and a watery curry sauce. The Roti itself was delicious and probably my favorite thing that we had. My second favorite dish was the Chicken Satay. The sauce was really good (it was heavily sauced). On top of the sauce was crispy fried garlic. I don't know if they make the crispy fried garlic in-house, but they were good and crunchy. I felt like I needed a bowl of rice to go with the sauce. (We actually did order 2 sides of rice, but it was dry.)

My husband is allergic to fish, so he got his own order of Fried Rice and Fried Noodles with pork, which looked like breaded and fried, shrimp (only a few pieces of shrimp between the two dishes) and Chinese sausage. He specifically requested ""no fish"" and they left out the fish cake, but forgot and left in the fish balls. It was okay, he didn't ingest any of the fish balls.

Gado Gado... my aunt said this dish was the biggest disappointment to her. She said they didn't use any Asian veggies, but Persian cucumbers, romaine lettuce, a triangle of crunchy tofu - looked like someone had made a Costco run for these items - and it was all drowning in this brown sauce that looked COMPLETELY unappetizing. See the picture and you'll know exactly what I mean without saying it. The sauce was very thick (like they didn't mix in the peanut butter enough) and just kind of sad looking. Even the shrimp chips on the plate seemed stale.
 
On to the next dish. My brother got a noodle bowl (Hoka?). He doesn't like eggs much, so he gave us his soy sauce egg, which was a bit rubbery. Nothing too exciting about his bowl. It actually looked like a hot mess.

Our last dish was the beef curry. It had little sides all over the dish. The sides consisted of sweet potatoes, cabbage, cucumber slices, a tofu triangle, a whole soy sauce egg doused in brown sauce and lastly, rice, which was also covered in sauce and topped with the crunchy garlic. The beef itself was a little tough, not tender and it wasn't ""saucy"" the way most curries should be. The sweet potatoes were strange and the cabbage was blah.

Drinks. My aunt got hot jasmine tea with sugar. My husband got already sweetened lemon iced tea. I got the hot coffee which was sweetened with one of my favorite things... sweetened condensed milk. The coffee was weak.

Our total bill was less than $75 bucks, so money-wise it was very reasonable. Would we go there again? It isn't on my shortlist, but I would go back for the Roti and Chicken Satay. If I could, I would have given them 2.5 stars but rounded up. My aunt (who doesn't know much about Yelp!) wanted to give it 1 star based on the Gado Gado alone. LOL

"blue-planet-drains-and-plumbing-chula-vista-6","""29/09/2021""",4,"Blue planet helped me out with a sink installation and the service was top notch. 

I've noticed that when I've had plumbing issues in San Diego, it's difficult to get companies to answer the phone, let alone come give a quote. Blue Planet was immediately responsive, and sent one of their best, Abraham, out to my home first thing the next morning. 

Abraham was very friendly and respectful of our desire to be masked in the home, and he helped us with a sink installation that, let's just say was best left to the professionals!

Overall I was satisfied with how everything went, and I will reach out to Blue Planet in the future for my plumbing needs. The reason I gave 4 stars is that I think we were quoted a higher price than the work merited. Long story short, initially it appeared that it would require 2 to people to get the job done. The second person that showed up was a trainee and mostly observed Abraham.

That being said, another reason I'm going to stick with Blue Planet is that when I noticed a minor aesthetic issue with the sink, I called the same night of the install to ask for help. Abraham came back first thing in the morning to make it right, no extra charge. I really appreciated that, and, I think it's indicative of the quality of work that Blue Planet does.","{""Friends"":0,""Location"":""San Diego, CA"",""Photos"":0,""Reviews_made"":1,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HjI2MPl4XiT1p-Bm2zoDlg"",""Username"":""Mark D.""}","null","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you for your feedback and comments"",""Date"":""03/10/2021"",""Title"":""BizUserReviewReply"",""User_Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/buphoto/HoqkIFT-7zK0n1maZLEiiQ/30s.jpg"",""Username"":""Miguel C.""}]",1,"","0 check-in","Blue Planet Drains & Plumbing"
"rifugios-country-italian-cuisine-deming","""27/08/2016""",5,"I was here for a Yelp event about two months back, and eager to try this place in a less formal setting. I was beyond thrilled with the outcome.

There were four in our party, two of us who had not been here before. When we walked in the door we were quickly greeted by Rifugio himself. He actually greets and serves all of the tables in the place, at least on the night we were there. Rifugio took the time to walk us through the current menu, we even got to see/smell some of the ingredients we were less familiar with, what a treat! We decided on the rock fish perogis, chef's lasagna, and the tortellini. 

While we were waiting for our food we got to listen to live music, and we were served green beans and bruschetta (that we had ordered as appetizers). Our appetizers were mouthwatering, I wish we had ordered more! We weren't entirely sure what the cost of our meal would be so we played it on the safe side, we came in under $110 for our whole meal so I would recommend ordering more apps. 

After much delightful conversation our three entrees came family style (by request) and they were delicious, I could have ordered a mountain of the tortellini. I was not a huge fan of the chef's lasagna, I know this changes quite frequently, ours came in a whole wheat casing that I found to be a bit overpowering. I would have rather ordered the house lasagna. It was still tasty, just not what I was expecting. 

With our group of diners dessert is also a must. We got a lemon cheese cake, and espresso lava cake. I know those aren't the exact menu items, but that is how I would describe them. Either way it was the perfect end to a delightful evening.

"borneo-eatery-alhambra-2","""14/02/2011""",4,"When my wife told me about this new restaurant in Alhambra, I actually got excited and invited my friends to eat here after a game of badminton in SGVBC. When I searched here, I found out that this place used to be called London Fish and Chips??? Well, the sign was still there, and I think there was a small sign of Kalimantan at the front. I hope they will fix this so people will be able to find this place.

So the place is located at the corner of main and garfield in Alhambra. It's very hard to find this place if I had not read that this place used to be London fish and chips. The place is kind of small, not more than 10 tables of 4 people, maybe more. It's your typical asian place. I wasn't expecting a PF chang kind of place. As far as cleanliness, I'd give a 4 star for asian restaurant.

The owner is really nice. They told me that they open the place 3 months ago. I really enjoy their service and they are attentive to filling our water and ask how our food was. Now, let me tell everybody this... Typical to any new asian restaurant (maybe mostly indonesian restaurant), they will pay attention to level of service toward the customer early in their business. However, after a few months of good business, they tend to forget that customer is always right :) and customer make their business work. Let's just hope they they can keep up this level of good customer service. This is also another reason why Sate House and Merry's House of Chicken are some of my favorite indo place.

So the menu is 2 pages long. It's not as long as some restaurant. But I really like what I saw in the menu. As soon as we saw what's in the menu we were all wanted to try every food in the menu. I was pleased with my friends reaction. I made the right decision by bringing them here. So most of my friends ordered the nasi campur kalimantan. I ordered Jam Mien Hakka and another of my friend ordered the bakso kuah kalimantan.

I am a ramen lover... So I had to try their noodle :)

When they brought out my noodle, everyeone ooh and aahs at the sight of the dish. The noodle was covered with bbq pork, fish ball and soy sauce egg. It look really delicious. Everyone was saying how good and delicious it looks. Then, the nasi campur came out. We were surprised of how much meat was on top of the plate (There were bbq pork, crunchy fried chicken, and chinese sausage). They were all happy with their dish. Although after trying out my noodle, they think that dish is the best.

So, it was a weird name for a noodle. Jam Mien Hakka. It's a stringy noodle that reminds of my bakmi alok from jakarta. It's a kalimantan noodle that just kick Janty Noodle to the curb. It has a lot of flavor and very ""gurih"" (as my good friend called it) gurih or delicious in many ways.

I love my noodle. I learned that this noodle is best serve dry. I didn't really like the noodle after I poured some sour chili sauce on it. But I still finished it anyway. The soup was also delicious.

Overall... it's a very good dining experience. Some of my friends claimed that they would definitely come again. As for me, I will definitely come here again for their Jam Mien Hakka.

Janty Noodle, with bakmi parahyangan and Rumah Makan Kalimantan, you are not the top of my list anymore.

Truth to be told, many of my friends now eat bakmi parahyangan instead of Janty Noodle. Like I always said... a smile bring many followers :)

A little fact that I just found out... Rumah Makan Kalimantan is my 100th review at yelp !!! Awesome !!!!!","{""Friends"":314,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/At_3GRPF5NkgxB2TkzG4dA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Placentia, CA"",""Photos"":98,""Reviews_made"":196,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-TT5e-YQU9xLb1JAGCGkQw"",""Username"":""Daniel T.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YIhsI8ke_SPh6RjzHAjrTg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OFoQBLr8wy8paW3nY_wZ0Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-N8798WOE6uSlZiNE5uwSg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":5,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",908,"","0 check-in","Borneo Eatery"

Now, as I have my (great) A3 maintained, I find the same high quality service from making an appointment through picking up the car after service.

When making an appointment for routine maintenance, I accidentally reserved a time at Volkswagen, Audi's partner.  I received a very polite call asking if I'd meant to reserve an Audi appointment, and then seamlessly scheduling with Audi.

I had my appointment this week, with Tony Alongi as my service agent.  I was a bit ambivalent about going in due to COVID, but the dealership has made their facility very safe - down to pens being sanitized before each use.  Tony could not have been more pleasant, professional, or helpful.  He explained everything clearly, made sure I understood both what would be done and how long it would take, and how he'd contact me when it was ready - which he did.  This was accompanied by a video review of the work done on my car by the service tech.

A person with Hypoglycemia may be getting dizziness, fatigue, or even nausea, limb numbness, etc. symptoms when she is hungry. This was almost happening with her feeling at that time and it is mostly the reason she is doing poor on your massage. Anyway, she felt guilty in the evening because of not telling the Hypoglycemia truth and she determined to resign from our team yesterday and will see the doctor quickly.\n\nAlthough you already finish half session of foot massage but not start another half session of body massage, I'm happy the young man in the front desk apologized for your inconvenience with already giving you back $100 ($84 refund plus $16 compensation).

"first-watch-ft-myers-9","""15/09/2019""",2,"Good grief.  How the heck can a breakfast place consistently screw up SCRAMBLED EGGS?! 

I want to love this restaurant, and I do like just about everything else about it, except the fact that their cooks do not know how to make scrambled eggs.  Updated interior is nice, wait staff is proficient and pleasant, the coffee is very good and the clientele are willing to be loyal - at least I was until today.  

But for the FOURTH time, I've gotten my eggs which looked like the attached photo.  It is an egg which has been opened up on the griddle, is cooked half-way through, and then is chopped into pieces of egg white and egg yolk.  It is not a creamy mix of egg cooked into curds.  

This time I decided not to suffer in silence again.  I told the waitress that this was NOT a scrambled egg.  She agreed but said they make ""country style"" scrambled eggs at First Watch.  She was kind enough to adjust the check, but that's not the point.  

The point is I've never heard of ""country style"" scrambled eggs and I don't know anyone else who has either.  Resident of Florida for 40 years and never had scrambled eggs served like this before.   

For the record, to show that I am not some ignoramus, here are some standard instructions from several different culinary sources which describe scrambled eggs:  

Culinary Institute of America:  Eggs are taken from the shell, MIXED UNTIL BLENDED, and then stirred over moderate heat until they set into soft curds.

Cook's Illustrated:  Heat butter or oil in a skillet; add EGGS BEATEN WITH WATER OR MILK; stir, stir, stir; and you're done.

Martha Stewart:  WHISK TOGETHER EGGS and cream; season with salt and pepper. Melt butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat; add eggs.

Seems pretty clear that these instructions confirm what most people expect:  Scrambled eggs are stirred/ whisked/ mixed BEFORE they are cooked.  

First Watch, rather than claim yours are ""country style"" scrambled eggs to disappointed diners, just say the truth; our cooks can't be bothered to crack a couple of eggs in a bowl and spend ten seconds to WHISK them before cooking, as is the standard cooking method for scrambled eggs.  
So how about just making that distinction clear on your menu?  In bold text, print something like this: ""NOTE:  First Watch scrambled eggs are NOT what you think they are, so here is a picture of what they will look like.""

Then feel free to use my non-copyrighted photo to illustrate your idea of scrambled eggs.  At least my eggs would not have died in vain and were good for something other than garbage can contents.  

Oh, and one more suggestion:  Save yourself considerable cost and stop sprinkling chopped parsley all over egg dishes!  It doesn't add anything to the taste and is nothing more than a bunch of texture-irritating flotsam on top of food.","{""Friends"":0,""Photos"":1,""Reviews_made"":32,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zlhAGTQANspQ7PpQbyK9sQ"",""Username"":""Lee V.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1SkYaaS-2nYU5CrfS5j4QQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",5,"","0 check-in","First Watch"

I've gotten acrylics hundreds of times and have never once experienced so much pain. Nail tech drilled down my nails to the point she was cutting through my nail at the base and it was bleeding, and then cut my cuticles which caused more bleeding. She finished the set and 2 days later both of my pinky nails are turned upwards and in severe pain. I am certain my natural nails are going to be ruined, if not torn off entirely once the acrylics come off.

We asked for a seat on the rooftop and were greeted by our server as soon as we sat down. My daughter got wax sticks with her kid's meal and was so entertained the whole meal long building and making things out of them.
We started brunch with an order of the beignets that came with four small beignets, berry jam, and a cream sauce. They were DELICIOUS and the berry preserves were incredible. For my main dish I got the mushroom and sweet potato hash (blend of wild mushrooms, sweet potatoes, baby spinach, peppers and grilled onions with sweet pepper coulis, topped with two eggs your way and served with cornbread) and loved every bite! My husband got the smoked brisket hash and eggs (hickory smoked beef brisket, BBQ house potatoes, grilled onions, green chilies, peppers, blended cheese and red chili ranchero sauce, topped with two eggs your way and served with cornbread) and enjoyed his equally as much as I enjoyed mine.

"tsujita-la-artisan-noodle-los-angeles-2","""12/03/2017""",3,"Pros? Service here is extremely quick once you're seated, and waiters and waitresses do a hell of a job moving people in and out of the place so that even if you're 16 parties deep, you're probably only waiting 30 minutes. It's also very easy to order, and their housemade noodles are springy and flavorful.

Cons? First, remember that it's a cash only establishment. Second, slurp with caution. This broth will sings your tongue and roof of your mouth. Third, the food is just so so. Everyone raves about the dipping ramen, but I'm not a guy that likes cold noodles and dipping sauce. I went in for the ramen, and it's very clear how much time and effort go into the famous 60-hour broth, but the meal itself was just okay. The broth is actually so freaking thick and fatty that the oil is already floating when you get your bowl. Portions of char siu are scant, but for only 1.50, they will bring you kaedama (an extra 4oz portion of noodles) with free soup.

"smashburger-elk-grove-5","""05/07/2014""",5,"I loves me some Smashburger! So, after the awesome Yelp event at Smashburger here in Elk Grove, I now had a ""free burger, sandwich, or salad"" coupon burning a hole in my pocket that was good ONLY at the Elk Grove location. ""Yay"" for coopin, but ""boo"" for sooooo far away. But I was bound and determined to cash that puppy in, despite the almost-20-miles-each-way-from-Natomas trek. I made sure the ol' Devo-mobile was gassed up for the looong drive, and off I went. 

I got to Smashburger at about 11:30, so there was plenty of parking, and plenty of room to sit either inside or out. Trust me, by the time I left at about 12:15, it was packed!  I chose inside because I avoid the heat if AC is available :) I perused the menu, thinking back to the slew of vittles I got to try at the Yelp event. Then, it just hit me...I wasn't in the mood for a burger, though I will say Smashburger's burgers are AWESOME for their freshness and variety. Nope, it was gonna be a chicken sandwich or a salad. Since I almost always err on the side of protein, the chicken sandwich won out...I'm sooooo glad I made that choice!

I settled on the truffle, mushroom, swiss chicken sandwich. Now, I'd had the truffle, mushroom, swiss burger at our tasting event, but let me tell you that having that tasty combo of truffle oil, grilled mushroom, and melty swiss cheese on a perfectly-grilled (read: not deep fried) chicken breast was DIVINE! OMG, it was sooooooo good! My sandwich came out all nice and hot and fresh...cooked to order, not having sat under a heat lamp, seasoned deliciously FRESH. Hot damn, was that one great chicken sandwich, and only $6.99 (well, free for me because of the coupon, but I'd buy that for a dollar, or seven). I loved it! And whilst chowing down, I was thinking how much Hubby would like this, since he's not much into burgers but loves a good grilled chicken sandwich. But I digress...

Since I had no out-of-pocket cost for the sandwich, I ordered the Smashfries, which are shoestring potatoes tossed in olive oil and garlic. Not bad, but I prefer thicker fries, which didn't stop me from eating every single last one of those things! 

The staff is uber-nice, too! The gal who took my order, the guy who brought out my food, and the dude clearing off all the tables (note; there's no garbage cans where you can clear your own table, which is crazy when it gets crazy busy and folks have to sit at a table with the previous customer's refuse all over it...just sayin'!). Still, nice staff make for a nice visit, so kudos to them.

I really hope that Smashburger looks at putting a store here in Natomas, because I can't afford to burn off three gallons of gas just to have lunch at their place in Elk Grove! Yeah, I know there's a Smashburger at Arden Mall, but the EG location is just soooo much nicer and has (to me) better quality and atmosphere. 

Regardless, next time we hit up Lodi for wine tasting, or have some urgent business that can ONLY be taken care of in Elk Grove, I'll be back with the Hubby in tow for a taste of Smashburger's awesome fare. :)","{""Friends"":971,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/TYyy0ts6rhVjhUDn1axt4Q/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Sacramento, CA"",""Photos"":3550,""Reviews_made"":1018,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UVVn8JcvIZ5fX5tE6Ne4Tw"",""Username"":""Devo S.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lGytooyIXaDSSgXsW8M14g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SHQfjUzL178V_FoMDBXv-Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/uKyuV3ELhicUDIopbXeCGg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wx_-r0vic024ogCNj2KD3A/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UyEegFJgFp6saWBh5NypVA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":8,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":6,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",204,"","0 check-in","Smashburger"
"borneo-eatery-alhambra-2","""25/05/2014""",5,"HOLE IN THE WALL! Found this place when someone tagged in on instagram and the food looked amazing so I knew I had to come give it a try. Never noticed the restaurant even though I pass by it ALL the time right by Pho 79 on Main and Garfield. I would suggest parking at the structure located on Main & First street.

Excuse my review as this is my first time eating malaysian/indonesian/singaporian food so I don't know the food names to well =)

Nasi Campur: 3 types of meat, flavored egg and cucumber on a bed of rice with gravy. The gravy was warm-cold but the amount of meat given was ridiculous for the price! The chicken by far was the best thing to eat with the rice. There is a particular sauce (they drop 2 off at your table) that you eat with this rice. Ask them which one it is!

Mie Goreng Kalimantan: This was the picture I saw on instagram that had me drooling. Thin egg noodles fried with bbq pork, fish ball, fish cake and some veggies. The flavor was different that any other noodles i've tried. SO GOOD!! Definitely recommend getting this if you come. I believe its #15 or #16 on the menu. 

Both dishes with tax turned out to be only $16.08. Our waiter was great. He knew it was our first time and we asked for his help. He laughed at us a couple times cause we were too noob but we'll get it right the next time!!

UPDATE: Now with COIVD-19 I've come back to my parents place but still pay for my spot at the UH. When I left I called and asked the from desk if they could hold all of my apartments packages in the front office since all my roomies and I moved back to our families. They told me they could do that for me. I put in the request bc I noticed that their new ""no contact"" delivery system just leaves the packages at peoples doors.... people walk in the hallways all the time and have the opportunity to take them. Which is what happened to my package. I called to complain and the guy on the phone told me that the delivery system is supposed to wait till someone answers the door, if no one answers it goes to the front office. THAT IS CLEARLY NOT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. My first package was stolen in front of our door and then my second package had been sitting outside my door for about a week before my roomie came back and picked it up.

I quickly checked Yelp and realised this coffee shop was pretty much over the road from where we'd parked the car, and John & Alisa R's rave reviews meant I knew it would be perfect. 

It's a cosy yet spacious coffee shop with big couches and lots of tables and chairs. It was pretty busy when we arrived but we managed to grab a spot on the couch which was perfect. I ordered us two cakes (chocolate brownie & Vic sponge) as well as a tea and a coke, and it came to something like £7. Super cheap! I would say the Victoria Sponge wasn't quite right for me - it wasn't really a sponge, more just like cake. I can't really describe it but it wasn't what I expected anyway.

The parking lot is small since the shoppe is on a main road. We couldn't find any spots on the first attempt so we had to turn into the main road to turn around and park in front of a closed store in the same strip.

There are plenty of large picnic tables for people to sit. It was brightly lit for night time, as well.

Sundaes has Gifford's ice cream, which I love. The flavor list was long and plentiful. The scooper was very friendly and allowed us to try multiple samples without any issue. He was able to describe any flavor and answer all questions.

We eventually picked Campfire S'mores and Chocolate PB Cookie Dough.

Flavor was spot on and consistency was perfect.

After we sat down, I noticed the line become very long and filled with teenagers.

"madurai-mes-san-antonio","""29/08/2018""",5,"Madurai Un-Mess, or Madurai YES! 
Well sometimes it just takes listening to what people like or cherish about a place (and trying it) to turn around an opinion. I wasn't wowed by the selections I made my first visit but took the suggestions from someone more intimate with So Indian cuisine ( thanks Venkat G.) so I could maybe experience it more fully. Can't wait to try this place with Don... hint hint ;)
It paid off though. Venkat's tip about Kushi Paniyarum, awesome! It's a small puffy 7 little ball appetizer ( crusty outside fluffy interior similar to Brazilian cheese bread) served with 3 fresh chutneys. These aren't the simple tamarind or fake green mint chili chutneys. No, these are fresh and each bursting with flavor. There's usually at least one that's a dud but not here. Served on a banana leaf and with a small Sambar in the middle. Yummy, heaven in a small bite.
     Now the Madurai Malli Dosa are interesting. I think for someone traveled or from the area this is probably a greatly welcomed taste. I liked it but wasn't drawn to it like I am the Kushi P. Will definitely eat it again, but will try some other Dosas first. BTW the Dosa was served with same chutneys (and Sambar) as the Kushi P. Not too repetitive for me since the chutneys were really good, but some might find it so. I was well sated.
    Still no Kulfi but they said it might happen in a week or two. Go all in, go SoIn. Enjoy.
    Other after thoughts... Their Chicken 65 to-go is the largest portion from any of the others who offer it.","{""Friends"":73,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/rNgUQlS_ieGBLfxKskYkxw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Portland, ME"",""Photos"":1193,""Reviews_made"":131,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=V7crcKY1NOgipt2NwRhNQA"",""Username"":""Adam H.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/TH_jej7ZtdYWIXsC3aUr7w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/07jnlRej8LOrb8mGa9MRuw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/AU7edqzfs3X9hmykRN8kuA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8BYesDALmIVodJZczbSpdw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/k-Z_9v3KoS_UkenO3SG7qw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/VVZF3Ee2RNGPvKcFqeI2ow/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NM9eRqUSNRpGxR2BBXXTzQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NG9LN3pkCNbaZw82Z7eBlw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Jk2RDri7obbf82MrBaePLw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/pIaq1i017Ap-9rTIiryWCQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":7,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":4,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Well, I got excited from the Google reviews n of this place because most of the Yelp reviews were supposed by the Yelp algorithm. Anyway, kept it simple because Friday will be Indian buffet with UYE crowd.\nSo  the water - and most everything else-- is served in or with metal vessels. Ok for food, but with water it imparts a taste I really don't care for.\nStarted with soup... A Rasam. I'm more familiar with Sambar. The Rasam is like a Sambar with more items swimming in it. It was tasty, and served piping *ss hot. Seriously hot temperature, and the chef/ kitchen person serving it put it on the table bare handed. It took me a couple minutes and attempts to jockey it close to me. Cold have used a napkin but threes no fun in that.\nNext came my Chicken Vindaloo. Wow, definitely the star ( and served in a small metal bucket). It was buttery and not as vinegary as others I've had. One thing lacking was spicy heat. I forgot to ask but Vindaloo should be self explanatory hot. Any way, still the right choice. Will try it again with heat. The accompanying basmati was a little odd. I couldn't tell if it was a little overcooked or not. It didn't seem the right fluffy. But if so it wasn't by much. Out was salty though. Not off putting to me but some might pick up on it.\nThe Naan came out late and turned to garlic LOL. None the less It was very tasty. Thin and not dried to H*ll, very pliable.\nLastly I desperately wanted some Kulfi which they list. Sadly they had none... Story of my life... Boy wants Kulfi and restaurant had none. \nTried to drown my sorrow with Chai instead. Seems to be the way they serve it Don, no sugar add your own. Taste wise, not my cup of tea. Not exactly sure which spice was used but it seemed like only one spice was used. It was definitely lacking clove, cinnamon, and cardamom... the three C's of any good chai.\nAll in all worth trying out. I think they are still new enough to consider in their soft opening stage.

We recently moved nearby, and had noticed that the lines were typically out the door at the two times we attempted to come without a reservation. So, third time's a charm, we learned from our mistake and booked a reservation. 

We came on the weekend when the Farmer's Market next door was up and running, which was pretty cool to see. We were seated downstairs, inside near the entrance and immediately greeted with a happy and energetic waiter. We hadn't woken up enough to return the energy, but it was truly appreciated to have that positive energy. He suggested el cubico, and we went with that suggestion just to try it out. 

Loved! Since then, we have returned two more times to make sure that it was as good as we remembered, and we still love it. Something about the avocado and the mix of ingredients just tastes so good and fresh! Cute little place in an active community and a nice place to visit and brunch.

I would come here often and I remember when this restaurant was only this restaurant and not any other locations. After Covid hit I noticed the quality of the food had changed. 
My favorite dish used to be Tu-Nuts. The texture of the fish has changed once the brought the item back (this item was actually gone for over a year because it was ""too expensive"" during Covid)
 I have noticed the food here in general just changed. Maybe they switched vendors for a cheaper option? 
I came here for lunch on March 11th and I order the Caes the day wrap. It's a chicken Caesar salad wrap.. my wrap came to me and my tortilla was MOLDY! 
I immediately lost my appetite  
I showed the dish to the manager, I kid you not her eyes widened, and they threw the dish away. How did the visibly moldy tortilla wrap make it all the way to the customer?! 
They were very kind about the situation and asked if I wanted something else and to be honest I don't want anything else from here. I'm worried it might have mold on it. 
They gave me a refund and we honestly are not going to be back.

I do wish I could give them 3.5 stars cause it's not quite a 4 more a bit better than 3. I definitely will keep going back for brunch, their dishes are pretty big portions and love their brunch menu drinks. But for their non-brunch menu I was a bit underwhelmed. The street corn and avocado dip was good but nothing special and that was the case for the other dishes as well. For the sushi tacos I felt like the soy wrapper was interesting but still would have preferred a regular tortilla or did like a deep fried seaweed tempura shell. It was not the easiest to eat. The truffle fries were pretty solid which is great! The service was decent as well. The ambiance was bustling and lively. I do hope that I get to try some other items on the menu for dinner.

It is still a solid place to visit for dinner but they are slightly pricier for the portions that they give you.","{""Friends"":215,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/xfL1cGa2iToDnZ1n5oa0wg/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Queens, NY"",""Photos"":604,""Reviews_made"":267,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bWRnKvZ1tQswVx8o-vS6Ug"",""Username"":""Sharon L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/OhgAdz5rsgGQyM4Pn5tMkQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jBcy-bq5hRncjoSY45eOug/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/JQMpQKYPaCcalNH9xUZdaQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GTRkVOtJ1p90HAkguxFZUg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":2,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Hi Sharon, \nThank you for taking the time to leave us a review.

"brueggers-bagels-hingham","""04/12/2020""",3,"The carb-craving has been real during the pandemic.  I try to eat bagels infrequently but  a couple of weeks ago my husband and I found ourselves unable to resist the idea of buying some for a weekend brunch for two...us!
I jumped in my car and headed to Bruegger's.

I was impressed with the availability of hand sanitizer posted throughout the store: by the door, both coming in and going out, at each register and other places inside. I find this to be a necessity these days and not just a nice touch.
There was only one other customer in the store so social distancing was easy.  Workers were masked and gloved.  I was waited on promptly.  I decided to buy a dozen bagels figuring I could freeze some of them.  A dozen bagels here is a ""baker's dozen"" meaning you get 13 of them.

Having grown up in NYC I know a good bagel and the bagels of my NYC youth were decidedly not the huge and too bready bagels that have been the rage almost everywhere for a couple of decades now.
The Bruegger's bagels are huge in my book.  They need to be about a third smaller than they are.  They aren't as bready as some others but I still would not want to eat one that wasn't toasted as I fear it would seem too marshmallowy.  A really excellent bagel in my mind is one that you would be as happy to have untoasted as you would toasted.

They sell a variety of cream cheeses here but I didn't buy any as we were just going to go with butter.  They also sell coffee and other hot and cold drinks.

That was all it took.  The green label (green apple flavor) reminded me of my beloved caramel apple suckers from junior high. So off we went, leaving the party on a mission to find more bottles of the good stuff!

Our first stop was to this Quickie Mart - (it was the first place we saw with a ""liquor"" sign out front) so we pulled in and went inside the crowded store. Behind the store sits an old motel.

"taco-bell-novato-2","""02/05/2016""",1,"Walk away... No, better run.  Run for the border, for the hills, or anywhere other than this particular location. 

I typically give strong ratings and notice good things, as can be noted in most of my reviews, but will also take the time to point out the not so good.   I wrote a truthful review a couple of months ago, which deservedly pointed out some service and hygiene issues, particularly with an individual who was apparently in charge. 

Today, after several months, I decided to give this location a second chance.  Big mistake.  Not only did I encounter the very same individual,  he actually knew my name and made it quite clear that he knew I wrote the review (scary).  I should have left right then and there, but silly me placed a small take out order. 

This person was very smug, and gloated that management didn't care about the review, and that he actually got a promotion to store manager.

Well, I wish him much success. 

This particular store is the shame of the chain, and
I certainly learned my lesson about this store and this employee.  We both know the truth, and in good conscience this person knows that he could have simply washed his hands when he came inside from cleaning the outside area to take my order, rather than his insisting that because he was only handling money, he didn't have too.  Especially when I asked him to, and he refused, to make his point. I disagreed, especially because he touched my cup (water) with those filthy hands; and wrote the review.  It was honest,  truthful and deserving; but I guess he's right after all, he didn't actually touch my food.

The electrician stated that he came to my house for a service call which is not what I schedule the appointment for. Jim refused to take responsibility for his company's mistake. Instead, he blamed me for being a poor client and not understanding the cost of labor or materials (no materials were used during the electrician's visit).

The full bar also didn't disappoint.  We had a coconut drink of some sort which was a speciality.  Again, the right mix of flavors which came out tasting good, rather than some overly sweet concoction.
The crowd had a decent vibe.  Service was okay.  They were struggling with staffing which meant there was long periods when you wouldn't see anyone, and you had go find them.  Just be patient, and understanding.  This is the world today.  It did seem like they were trying their best.

"spotless-cleaning-services-brooklyn","""26/06/2023""",2,"I contacted Ada for a deep clean as we have an apartment that needed work done prior to the arrival of a new tenant. We specifically mentioned to Ada and the cleaners that we need focus on the interior and exterior of the refrigerator, microwave, stove, and dishwasher. 

Ada's crew came on time and were very friendly. They brought all of their own materials which was also nice. I reminded them of the areas that needed extra focus and let them work as I didn't want to hover the entire time. 

An hour or so later I went to check in and it looked like they were making good progress. There were a few areas I spotted that needed to be looked at again and asked if they can let me know when they're done so I can take a look at the work. Another hour or so later and I realize that they left without letting me know. No worries, so as long as they got the job done. Unfortunately this is where things take a turn. 

Upon inspection of the areas I told them to focus on I see very visible grease stains, dirt that was never cleaned, on areas that were substantial and large that it baffles me how they could ignore it - just to reiterate this wasn't a few small areas. At this point Ada texts me asking how the job went and I relayed the message. She kindly mentioned that she would be happy to resend the cleaner the following day. I appreciated the gesture but just given the lack of attention to large areas I didn't want to take her up on the offer. We ended up spending an extra 2-3 hours cleaning ourselves - that's about the amount of time they spent on the entire job. 

So to summarize, Ada and her staff are friendly folks but the cleaning is definitely not spotless and not worth it given the cost.

I have come here a couple of times now, and plan on coming back regularly for breakfast. 
It's a big space, and it's usually busy when I've come for breakfast on the weekend. The booth seats are kind of uncomfortable, but that's pretty much the only negative comment that I have. 
When you order coffee, you get a whole pot at the table which is great for refills. I like getting the build-a-breakfast for $10.95, it's huge and a great deal! I usually get eggs, bacon, tater tots (soooo yum) and pancakes that actually taste light and fluffy. You also get your choice of three syrups. I want to try their cinnamon roll French toast next time...it sounds amazing!
On my visits, the manager was very active in the restaurant and came by to make sure we were having a great visit. He asked how we heard about them, and thanked us for our business. You can sense that he truly does care about his patrons. 
When you're done, they have some fresh baked pies and muffins to bring home too. Service has been fast and efficient, and I'm really happy that I have a new breakfast spot!

"der-biergarten-atlanta","""17/06/2017""",3,"Visiting Atlanta and going to the Georgia Aquarium but didn't want to eat there, so I yelped and found this promising place. We got here around 12 noon on a Sunday. Only 5-6 other tables were there when we arrived. 

Food: jagersnitzel and spaetzl as the side. The jagersnitzel was good - generous portion - crispy and thin. Loved the spaetzyl too! My first time to try it and thought it was delicious! My husband ordered the bratwurst and enjoyed his meal as well. He did say the sauerkraut was quite sour though. 

Why the 3 stars if good food then? Well we spent over 2 hours there when we waited for our food for about 30+ minutes. Our appetizer never came out and when the waiter checked on it, apparently the kitchen didn't tell him they were out of something and couldn't make it. Poor communication! We also ordered the apple strudel dessert which apparently they also ran out of, but the waiter didn't know that until 5 minutes later. Seriously?? Well, then I decided to get the German chocolate cake which still took a good 15 minutes to come out. How long does it take to cut a piece of cake? Sigh. All that hassle and management should of at  least offered a free dessert or something but nope. I don't blame the waiter who apologized several times for the wait and was sweating with all the tables he had to manage ( pretty much the entire dining room)! Management needs to hire more staff and be present. I didn't see anyone that seemed to be in charge. :o

The Tsukemen was a new experience for me. I felt like it was too thick and salty and I honestly felt a little queasy with the overpowering flavors (no idea why, maybe a personal preference). There was a generous portion of fatty pork belly.

The ramen itself is also technically good, but again, it was way too salty and the broth was too thick and rich for me (a complaint I have never had before). There was also a generous portion of pork belly, that seemed to be overwhelmingly fatty for me.

"central-diner-and-grille-pittsburgh","""31/01/2018""",4,"Overall Impression: 4.5
Home-style cooking with generous portions that has something for everyone in the family.

The Food:
Let me tell you about the specials board, because it's where it's at! The restaurant is owned by Greek family who specializes in Mediterranean and Greek dishes, and there is definitely plentiful options when it comes to that cuisine. I ordered a classic from the specials board when I was there--a stuffed pepper with mashed potatoes; one of the ultimate comfort foods and one of my favorites as a child. It did not disappoint! Not only was it huge, but it was covered in a delicious tomato sauce and cooked perfectly. There's nothing like a fountain of stuffed pepper sauce spilling over into a mountain of creamy mashed potatoes. I couldn't even finish the whole thing--I took half home for my boyfriend to eat, and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. I've also enjoyed their Buffalo Chicken Salad, which was HUGE and definitely hit my buffalo chicken cravings at the core.

The Restaurant:
On our last visit we sat outside in the middle of winter. How? They have huge enclosed heaters in the middle of each outdoor section that really do have the feeling of a fireplace. The inside of the restaurant is generally very noisy, as they usually have big parties and families (kids screaming combined with older people hard of hearing), but as long as you don't mind that, everything else is fine. I know in the past they failed a health inspection, but they're clean on the floor. There is always a wait on the weekends because of their popularity, and that attests to their focus on a quality home-cooked meal. Finding a parking spot is difficult because of how many people go there. The servers are friendly and very on their toes due to their volume of customers and are very quick to grab anything you need. Their owners are hands-on and are all over the place when I'm there, attending to everyone's tables and asking everyone if their enjoying their experience.


TL;DR
If you had a bad day and need some amazing comfort food in your life or want a huge meal for a reasonable price, this is the place to go. Their diverse menu that pairs classical home-cooked meals with Greek flare has everyone west of Pittsburgh coming to eat there, and you should too.","{""Friends"":129,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/OAU-LCmfC_Qjq1SXvkhE_Q/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Coraopolis, PA"",""Photos"":12,""Reviews_made"":8,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ntD-wlI4fribwcq9VSHB4w"",""Username"":""Kelli M.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/92rVhD91IKLAWfIUnbi8Ig/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",403,"","0 check-in","Central Diner & Grille"

I've been to Brazil, and this was at least as good as any I tried there.

The moqueca was definitely the star of the show. The coconut broth was savory and decadent and went perfectly with the shrimp, mussels, squid, and halibut.

I got the steak meal from the brunch menu. Reginald recommended I get the steak medium (although I naturally go for medium well), he led me in the right direction because that was probably the best medium steak I've had in an extremely long time. I paired it with a mango caipirinha which was absolutely delicious (yes, they used real mango juice). 

My dad got the fried chicken and cheese grits. He loved the grits and was glad it wasn't just cheddar mixed in. He did mention that the chicken was a bit too salty for his liking, but still enjoyed the meal in general.

The cheesy bread was nice but I've had better. The chicken wings were thoughtfully cooked with the right amount of garlic and time of frying. The beef stroganoff was pleasantly tasty with its sweetness. Though, it was surprising to have eaten chicken in this dish when it's supposed to be beef? The black bean stew with pork was delectable; I thoroughly enjoyed the several different pieces of pork in the stone pot it came with and ate as much as I could. 

I can see myself returning to try other dishes for sure. Only next time, I will not opt to sit outside at the garden because it was sweltering hot and we were baking back there.

The only downer to my experience was the fact that the hostess ""lost"" our reservation so we weren't able to be seated in the outdoor patio. The hostess offered us a seat on the street (which would've been extremely chaotic and absolutely not what we wanted) or an indoor table. We ultimately went with the indoor table, but it would've been nice to not have this issue or at least get a free appetizer or drink for the inconvenience. 

Otherwise, the service and food were FANTASTIC. I loved the waiter who gave us recommendations for a bottle of red (we went with the Pinot Noir).

I'd recommend making a reservation beforehand online. I came with a large group and they were really responsive via email. When my group got here, they actually didn't have a table ready for us yet and we waited around 30min. But the hostess was really apologetic and ended up giving us a round of free drinks! They were also really acclimating and allowed us to close the blinds and fan since it started raining. 

I ordered the Filet Mignon Strogonoff ($29), Guava Caipirinha ($13), and Pão de Queijo ($8). The food is on the pricier side, but you're in Greenwich and the portion sizes are filling. The Pão de Queijo (Brazilian cheese bread) is chewier than ones I've previously tried and it makes for the perfect appetizer. Just make sure to eat it right when it comes out and it's hot. The Strogonoff comes with rice and chips and it had a lot of flavor to it, but it was really creamy and heavy. I tried my friend's vegan one and I actually preferred that one since it didn't contain cream.

"berimbau-brazilian-kitchen-west-village-new-york","""14/11/2020""",3,"Let me start out by saying I love the ambiance (5 stars). It's a beautiful, well-decorated restaurant with careful touches that make the place cozy,  inviting, and intimate. 

The service also deserves 5 stars. 

For an appetizer, I had a cheese empanada ($5). They have four other types of empanadas which I would love to try if I ever returned (beef, shrimp, spinach & ricotta, and heart of palm empanadas). There's a shareable appetizer for 3 empanadas for $15 as well.

My friend had the yucca fries ($8) and they were delicious.

For the entree, I got the stroganoff, $20, and added $7 for the filet mignon. It came with rice and very thin, crispy potato bites. Unfortunately, although my entree looked delicious, the flavor was overwhelmingly pungent with a Dijon mustard taste paired with quite a sweet undertone. Since I was very hungry, I did eat most of it but the strong and overwhelming mustard combined with the saccharine quality did not work for me, especially by the end of my meal. 

I think perhaps I just got the wrong entree! I would be willing to go again and get something else. If you like mustard or more sweet, creamy sauces you may love the stroganoff. 

Also, my friend whom I came with had the vegan stroganoff and she said she didn't have the issue with the strong Dijon mustard flavor. She said hers tasted like coconut milk and tomato and she loved it. So perhaps I would try the vegan stroganoff instead next time!","{""Friends"":212,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/7osWaugFjA9YofbHFcVDtA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""New York, NY"",""Photos"":700,""Reviews_made"":292,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NUCfSHTWTdg3GcALpPLNDw"",""Username"":""Tina S.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jbgvrcWp79xkuotD-h2gmQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WO8H5FVujlIJkvlsaVqplQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oXxOqY4dn4oc1yWRnFjkEA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6VBYmbnL6Eom_iHjZe0nqw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xLWqQpavXk4cV6lxgygDiw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/wdybuiN0Oy4HWBWyoOVZ3g/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/svhWmGPyzizApZ5TvB0bXQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","[{""Content"":""Thank you for letting us know about this.

"berimbau-brazilian-kitchen-west-village-new-york","""11/11/2023""",4,"I came  to Berimbau with my boyfriend and a friend. We had a reservation at 7pm for 3 on a Friday night and were seated right away in their inside area when we arrived. It is probably best to get a reservation since the space does appear to be limited. This restaurant is very cute and cozy on the inside. It's pretty small but this gives it a more intimate feel while still holding a very casual ambiance to it (it kinda felt like we were eating in someone's home!) Our waitress was very nice and super patient while we decided on what drinks and food to order. We all tried the classic caipirinha which was very nicely presented, and was very refreshing with a nice flavor of lime without being too sweet. There was a moderate amount of alcohol despite the misleading low volume so make sure you pace yourself! For food we tried:

- Pao de Queijo: an order of 5 pao de queijo which comes freshly baked in a basket. These are so good! They were warm, soft, and had a rich cheesy inside while keeping a nice crispy crust on the outside. The cheese they use is very mild so these aren't too salty and don't feel too greasy either. Very good appetizer to share! Might honestly have to order two sets next time because these are so good and you cannot get enough. 

- Chicken Stroganoff: I ordered this and thought it was fantastic. This is a comforting, creamy stew with chicken and mushrooms that come in a tomato based sauce which was mildly sweet and acidic. It came with a side of rice to soak up all the delicious sauce as well as some crispy potato sticks which added a salty and crunchy touch to balance out the sweet/acidic components. Definitely order this one! Very good and filling. 

- Moqueca Baiana: seafood medley in this delicious creamy coconut sauce that is so rich, it transports you to a tropical place! The flavors are vibrant, well balanced, and the dish is very filling. This came with some squid, shrimp, mussels, and a fillet of halibut which was a little bit overcooked for my taste but not too noticeable since it comes in a sauce. I think this also comes with rice but they gave us only one portion to share (with the stroganoff) which I personally did not think was enough-- I wish they had given us more since this goes fantastically with rice and the farofa (toasted yucca flour) which also comes on the side. 

- Arroz de Pato: my friend ordered this and I did not try it but he really enjoyed it! The portion of duck looked generous and also came with plenty of rice. 

Overall, I really liked this place! The vibe is very lowkey and casual, the service is friendly, and the food + drinks are really good. Portions are generous for the most part except for some of the side dishes like rice and the dishes are well executed. Prices are pretty reasonable for the food compared to other places around here although drinks are still pretty expensive and will definitely add up. Really nice amWill be coming back in the future whenever I crave Brazilian food again.

Food was delicious! We ordered the Fjearda which is like black beans with a ton of flavor, mixed with sausages, and pork ribs( I think). Almost like a black bean stew that pairs very nicely with the rice they give. 

The pork belly was also good, very tender, but not my favorite flavor.

"berimbau-brazilian-kitchen-west-village-new-york","""22/03/2023""",4,"Nestled in the heart of the city, this Brazilian restaurant offers a delightful array of dishes that are sure to tantalize your taste buds. The pao de queijo, a traditional cheese bread, was outstanding and served warm, with a perfect balance of chewiness and airiness. For those looking to quench their thirst, the Brazilian Passion Caipirinha is a must-try, offering a fruity and refreshing twist on the classic cocktail.

Other standout dishes included the coxinha, a popular Brazilian snack consisting of shredded chicken encased in dough and fried to perfection. The picadinho, a traditional Brazilian beef stew, was packed with flavor and generously portioned, ensuring a satisfying and hearty meal. However, the chicken stroganoff left a bit to be desired --  the portion size was smaller than expected, and it was a bit bland.

Sometimes , it could be somewhat challenging to catch the attention of the waitstaff, especially when seated in the outdoor patio especially. Definitely nice place to sit generally though the patio heaters may not be sufficient to keep you warm on colder evenings, so it's best to choose an indoor table when the temperature drops.","{""Friends"":134,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/JILWIZR3sAgWczi0lvAu5Q/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Embarcadero, San Francisco, CA"",""Photos"":675,""Reviews_made"":59,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BNyDiXCdidh_6HO0cA2QCw"",""Username"":""Ron G.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MSa4bnaqUBHtrGwrHh9Ydg/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",5,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Berimbau Brazilian Kitchen - West Village"

It's a brand new experience to have a group dinner that you are not able to see the rest of 5 people on the other side of the room. The food itself was great, tasted pretty good. Their cocktails were not so good and more like juice or water down beverage. Service was terrible, only 1 person is running for a small back room and you have to wait for 15 minutes for a simple lime slice for your water. Almost impossible to find your waiter when you need him, and even when you get a chance to say your request, you need to prepare to wait for 15 minutes or more. Environment and decoration were both good, would be a nice choice for a couple. Street parkings are available and pretty easy on the weekend but i won't recommend to try especially for those who need to make their way from Long Island or Brooklyn.

The restaurant has a patio with additional seating in the back along with outdoor seating in front of the restaurant. My preference is to sit inside but the most recent time I ended up outside. It wasn't a problem though because the outdoor seating is very well heated. 

Everything here is done well. You can't go wrong with any dish you choose. The two things I will always get though are the cheese balls and the stroganoff. Those two dishes are the best of its class. 

If you like cocktails you're in luck because the restaurant has a number of tasty cocktails. It's one of my favorite places to grab a drink.

My friend and I arrived around late afternoon on the weekend, but we were still able to get a table in their backyard area. The outdoor seating is fully heated so don't be scared. In fact, it was so hot that I had to turn off the heating lamp. The backyard is very cute and decorated with plants all around the space. Like most places these days, you can view the menu by scanning the QR code. My friend and I got the chicken strogonoff and moqueca baiana (seafood stew). The chicken strogonoff was made with cream, mushroom, garlic, and tomatoes. Indeed, this dish was extremely creamy but somehow it's light. The strogonoff reminds me of green curry but less spicy and lighter. Along with the strogonoff, you also get crispy potato sticks and rice on the side. I thought the rice was very dry. No other rice can compare to my favorite elephant jasmine rice brand ! 

I had ordered moqueca baiana, but our waiter mixed up another order. He was quick to correct my order though so thumbs up for you Cory! It comes with farofa (toasted cassava flour) and rice. Cory said to mix the rice and moqueca baiana together and top it with the farofa. This is my first time trying farofa and to me it feels like the breading you have on katsu. The moqueca baiana was packed with a lot of squid, shrimp, and mussels. There's so many things going on in this dish, but they managed to make it taste very light and creamy. The sauce - I just keep going back to it. It's not soup but I literally drank this up like soup. 

Highly recommend trying Berimbau out if you're in the area.

I did some research on NYC restaurants known for fun outdoor dining and I found Berimau on TikTok, so I made a reservation on Resy. I was with a party of 5 and we sat outdoors in their back patio area. The décor and ambiance were lovely - There are some cool neon signs to take nice group pictures with.

We were seated right on time and started with some cocktails of course. I had the Caipirita ($14) which is essentially their version of a spicy margarita - I highly recommend. We also shared the chicken & cheese croquettes ($13) and cheese empanadas ($13). Both were tasty, but the empanada stole the show.

For my meal, I ordered the Moqueca Baiana ($29) which is a seafood stew containing a HUGE piece of halibut along with some shrimp, calamari, mussels and a delicious coconut milk base broth - OMG yum. Halibut is one of my favorite fish and I was so happy this dish was well-done & really complimented the star of the dish. My friends also tried a few other dishes that they raved about, including the Strogonoff ($22) and the Salmon ($25). We had to end this delicious meal on a sweet note, so we ordered the brigadeiro (which are creamy chocolate fudge balls - $10) and the caramel flan ($10). Everything was cooked to perfection and I had an amazing time celebrating my birthday with great food, drink, ambience and company.

The outdoor setup was perfect - spacious and warm! We started with Caipirinhas (my brother had a cocktail, which I forgot the name of) which were well balanced and refreshing. We also had apps which consisted of the cheese bread (yum, but different than I expected, because the cheese filling wasn't typical American ""cheese pull"" style), and three empanadas; two spinach and cheese, and one that had meat in it. The empanadas were tasty, but it was creamed spinach, rather than spinach + cheese filling. 

Food: my brother got the Feijoada, and his gf and I got Moqueca Baiana dishes. All dishes were accompanied with breadcrumbs to sprinkle on top of the dish, and rice. Ask for the house made hot sauce! My brother loved his dish, and from trying a small bit of it, the flavors worked very well together. My dish was not only delicious, but unique - you can taste the essence of the coconut milk used, but the other flavors along with the seafood atop the rice, the breadcrumbs, and dash of hot sauce to finish sent my tastebuds on quite the delightful ride! 

I want to give Berimbau 5 stars, but unfortunately I got sick once I returned home and could not keep it down. I mentioned this to my folks the next day to find out that my brother's gf had also felt nauseous that night, but luckily didn't have the same reaction. Bear in mind, I only had 2 drinks (I have drinks regularly), and she only had one.","{""Friends"":27,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/HdNnodU83kzztkw9vbMNow/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""New York, NY"",""Photos"":41,""Reviews_made"":82,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xjodO7rlWywZfGMUOyWQaA"",""Username"":""Vanessa E.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/4ls9oudl3jxgq0tYNSB8qQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/a52PvjzENiow3GEi8jVaRA/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",103,"","0 check-in","Berimbau Brazilian Kitchen - West Village"

We both ordered the chicken and waffles and wow it was everything I was looking for! Super soft and chewy Brazilian cheese bread in waffle form. The chicken was not dry at all. Maple syrup hit perfectly with the pairing. There is a bit of syrup at the bottom though that the waffle and chicken sits in so might be too sweet for some.

We started off with Pão de Quiejo which is their cheese bread which surprised me & reminded me of a mochi bun! It wasn't my favorite cheese bread however.

A friend ordered the beautiful Moqueca Baiana with a bounty of seafood! However he asked for salt. I got the tender Filet Mignon Stroganoff which I highly recommend while my other friend ordered the chicken version. I laaaave the textures with the crispy fried potato strings with the stew & rice. It was such a delicious & fun dish to eat. I didn't know there was a Brazilian version of stroganoff & highly prefer this than the common version I am aware of.

No room for dessert except for the caju mocktail i ordered! Caju is Brazilian for cashew & they explained is the fruit outside of the nut! Tastes like pear , very refreshing but as a mocktail they added bubbles & would have preferred it without.

Reservations are highly recommended and obtainable via Resy. My friend and I came here on a Friday night for dinner. We checked in with the hostess and after a minimal wait we were shown to their back garden. I loveddddd this space.... Slightly disconnected from the restaurant but still in the thick of it. 

Our waitress was a doll!! As soon as we were seated she came over, introduced herself, asked if we've been before and began giving us recommendations. Everything she recommend was good. When ordering your drinks you have the option to request less sugar so that it's not on the sweet side. About the drinks.... Balanced is an understatement. The mango caipirinha was so refreshing yet strong. 

We shared cheese bread and wings. The wings were some of the best I've had.... Full of flavor and crispy. For my meal I went with the Duck Breast. Whenever Duck is on a menu I'm going to order it. Glad I did! Perfectly cooked with smoked sausage and rice. Huge portion so I was able to carry some home. 

Berimbau is a gem!!

Mario, the owner, suggested we come back and give them another try. On him. Not that easy since we live in CT, but the call of the feijoada, the need to ""matar as saudades"" (kill the longing?), was just too hard to resist so back we went.

I just wish the food hadn't been so good. But it was, which means at some point we will just have to pile in the car again and drive 100 miles round trip for what is undoubtedly the best Brazilian food in the NY metro area. The feijoada was served piping hot with the elegance of a French five-course meal. The quantities were more than enough to satisfy a day laborer. One bite and we knew that there was real Brazilian chef in the kitchen. Victor, a multinational transplant like ourselves, made sure the service was on point without being solicitous. And looking around and seeing the smiles we knew we were not the only happy patrons.

He proceeds to say the heater was not gonna work because we were touching the switch and it was our fault. He was the one who told us to try to turn it on after the time frame he gave us. He was completely disrespectful, unprofessional and unnecessarily aggressive to a point my friend was crying out of frustration and I was so upset we just wanted to leave. After fixing whatever in the basement he got the outlet finally on (as the green light on it wasn't even turned on before) and consequently the heater started working. This whole time the problem was the outlet energy source. He never apologized and in fact kept belittling us and what we were saying. He proceeded to ignore our table for a while and I think his shift was over since someone else started serving our table and others at the garden. The new one is someone we know (Dino) and always had great experiences with. We actually try to go at times we know he will be there because his service is beyond great and we appreciate him so much. \nWe payed and went to talk to the manager about it. He was just okay with it and didn't show much care for the situation. \nI love Berimbau and their food but this kind of service is unacceptable. Having  a server harassing us in the middle of a restaurant was the most horrifying and humiliating experience I had in my whole adult life. \nI hope this message reaches Berimbau and their management and that they can give proper training to their staff."",""Date"":""19/01/2023"",""Images"":[],""Username"":""Thays A.""}]",110,"","0 check-in","Berimbau Brazilian Kitchen - West Village"

Savory waffle - HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE! The waffle part was super delicious & was basically pao de quejio. It had pork shoulders, sunny side egg & guava-biquinho sauce. Super delicious, cheesy, savory, etc. Love this item the most!

I personally really liked my order or moqueca baiana with lots of seafood and good sauce. The friend who got the mussel dish also enjoyed it. Apparently the Feijoada was just okay but the filet mignon stroganoff was terrible. It was so sweet that it went unfinished.

I also did not like it when I tried it- have never had such a sweet stroganoff. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but had to take into account what my group said as well.

I recommend this dish to share family style. The way the portions are, seriously, it is better to split several dishes. I usually don't want to do that, but I usually make an exception with Brazilian food. 

The Feijoada was delicious. Great flavor. Good amount of pork pieces, even some pork belly in the one I received, but I imagine your mileage may vary with this soup style dish. A ton of beans, which goes back to this being a perfect dish to share. It normally comes with a small rice. 

The waiter was very familiar with the menu, very friendly, and very helpful. The service was fast.

The Pão de Queijo was good but not great. Compared to Trader Joes Brazilian Style Cheese Bread, it didn't taste much different. And in terms of price, Trader Joes gives more bang for your buck. 

For the main course, I ordered the Fraldinha Saltada. I love yuca fries and they were great in the dish. However, I would have liked the Fraldinha flank steak to be a little more pink inside and less overcooked. I also would have liked a few more pieces of the steak in the dish because for a Fraldinha/ steak dish, there was a low ratio of steak to yuca and onions.

As for the other main dishes, the Bobó de Camarão was good and flavorful. And the Feijoada Vegana was a standard vegan bean stew dish.

When I first came here five years ago, I thought the moqueca was the best in the city. It's still good, but like everything else in inflation times, the portions are smaller. (Or maybe I'm richer and therefore expect more?)

Anywho, the Pão de Queijo is on the chewier side, while the Pastéis are near perfect. The Torresmo will fill you with fried pork belly umami until your arteries choke, ""No more!"" 

Entree-wise, Brazil's national dish is decently represented in the Feijoada, but I missed the trimmings (ears, innards, other parts that gross out Americans)--THAT'S the mark of authenticity. The aforementioned Moqueca Baiana could've been larger and stew-ier, but the flavors were on point. I enjoyed the Bobó de Camarão (a favorite from Rio), but it was a teeny-tiny appetizer size...so if you like sharing one shrimp with three people, you might like it too. Plant-based folks will enjoy the bigger (and heartier) Vegan Strogonoff. 

The Yuca Puree might put some people off with its texture, but just add lots of farofa to thicken it up. The Creamy Spinach is another side, but so big, it should replace the Bobo as an entree. The Brigadeiros were lovely.","{""Friends"":863,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/ou4NBw2cy-y6st4hYfumwA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Manhattan, NY"",""Photos"":2668,""Reviews_made"":2445,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=s16-BUo-orUsELvMu5ocKg"",""Username"":""Josephine L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-zCaGWyGBNGSHhyuIKnSSg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CbgK6EtxZzwTiTPAA7rbSw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Af9tadI7sDfIzTLtazlQmg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zefkMCp8MVCmcu9Cc8-gFw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iipWTW7nSHYJnVr_SmkY5w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/NYgjN_YBWJTvgkFCPpuy6w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K4JOZ96OkESNyxuB3kSKYw/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/aJSMv6L1tHtTVdHmiH51LQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":1,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",8,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Berimbau Brazilian Kitchen - West Village"

I was super annoyed cause how do you run out of coconuts by noon when you open at 11am? Anyway, I ordered a cocktail which was tasty but not what I wanted. For food I got the strogonoff.

The decor and ambiance felt really welcoming and homey, and we didn't feel rushed to order our food. We ended up trying their pao de queijo (cheese bread), coxinha (croquette), picanha tom jobim, chicken stroganoff, and bobo de camarao. For drinks we went the wholesome nonalcoholic route and chose caju juice (cashew juice), mango juice and limeade. Everything was delicious - so rich and full of flavor! There wasn't a single drink or dish that we didn't thoroughly enjoy. One of the members of my group grew up in Brazil, and he confirmed that the dishes tasted authentic.

We came here on a Sunday evening that happened to be the Halloween parade, and surprisingly it wasn't crowded. 

What brings up the ratings for this restaurant is not only the decor, ambiance, but most of all, the food. The Pão de Queijo is something I still think about to this day quite frankly. They were extremely chewy but not too heavy, making it a perfect side dish to munch on throughout the evening. I also really want to highlight the Strogonoff - it comes in a cute set up with rice, beans, the strogonoff itself, and crispy potato sticks on the side. You must eat everything all together and combine it into one bite because this was so full of flavor and different textures all at once in the best way possible. Other dishes we also ordered was the Salmao and Moqueca Baiana, the latter being quite similar to the Strogonoff in some way, with a little less spice in my personal opinion.

"berimbau-brazilian-kitchen-west-village-new-york","""23/06/2021""",4,"I discovered this wonderful little Brazilian restaurant with my friend while walking around the West Village. I fell in love with the outdoor dining concept, which was a beautiful structure with sliding glass doors and gorgeous greenery. They also have a backyard patio, but unfortunately there was no outdoor dining available when we visited. However, the interior was also lovely with natural lighting, cool unique hanging lamps shining brightly, along with exposed brick and a white and brown color scheme.

For the appetizer, we had to order the cheese bread. There was a decent amount and they were filled with irresistible and cheesy flavor. They were also perfectly sticky and just the right chewiness and texture.

I selected the Fraldinha Saltada for my entrée, which consisted of skirt steak, tomatoes, red onions, yuca fries, cilantro, with a side of rice. It was heavy on the fries, and could have used more steak, but otherwise, absolutely delicious! The steak was well seasoned, tender, juicy, and intensely flavorful. The yuca fries were cooked beautifully... They had a nice crispiness and also somehow still moist. The accompanying sauce was really tasty, and I'm hard to please when it comes to tomato-based sauces. It was wonderfully savory and intensely flavorful. The red onions added a bit of crunchiness and freshness. Even the rice was good, with a little bit of green onion. 

My friend had the Galinhada, which was organic chicken with black rice and baby carrots. The chicken skin was delightfully crispy, and the meat was oh so succulent and yummy! The black rice was also quite flavorful with different spices. 

Service was superb. My friend actually knew the waiter, so we got extra cheese bread, which we could barely finish because the meal was that filling. I would definitely return to try the Bobo De Camarao, a dish with shrimp and coconut milk.

"berimbau-brazilian-kitchen-west-village-new-york","""28/03/2021""",5,"Small spot but so great! My friend actually found this place when we were looking for a place to brunch and i'm happy we listened to her. The inside is a bit small so we opted to sit outdoors and so glad we did. All of the staff were wearing masks and the tables were fairly distant so I felt a little comfortable. The outdoor space has a nice heating element that makes you forget that you're outdoors. 

For drinks, we got the caipirinha sample flight. (it's only available during brunch on sundays) It's basc a flight of their most pop flavors and it's recommended if you're looking to sample the drinks instead of buying one. I ordered the brazilian passion & the caipirita. Both were v good and strong but I preferred the caipirita. If you like spicy margaritas, I recommend going with this one. 

To start, we went with their empanadas (beef, shrimp and cheese) and the coxinha (chicken croquettes). The croquettes was the true star of the appetizers and the beef empanadas came in second. The croquettes were crispy on the outside but inside it's soft and creamy. The other flavor emps were eh. 

For our entree I got the bobo de camara's and it was soo good. It looks small but it's a lot of food (I had leftovers). They give you more than enough pieces of shrimp which is great and the sauce was super rich and flavorful. My friend got the seafood stew which she said was bomb and my other friend got the fraldinha saltada which she also said was great.

My friends and I agreed hands down 5stars for food. My fav dish is the steak stroganoff. I strongly recommend it. It's creamy, the steak and the mushroom bites pair very well with the sauce and the fried yuca adds nice texture to the dish. I can't finish it in one sitting, I always take the leftover home. But this time the server forgot to wrap it for me :( My friends got the Seafood Moqueca, the seafood stew. It was also creamy and delicious. If you love squid, this dish is for you. Both entree came with rice, pretty good portions. 
The server was nice but not attentive. She would forget to close the door, forget to bring plates and napkins. The worst part was not apologizing after she spilled the cocktail :'(
Usually the service is great here. I will be back when it's a little warmer outside. Even with the heat lamps and ""outdoor"" dining setup, I was still cold. (Today 32*)

In my humble opinion, Berimbau is by far the best Brazilian restaurant in the city and one of my overall favorite restaurants in New York. 

Their brunch and dinner menus are incredible. I have tried many different items and until now I haven't had one that I didn't like. My favorites are the pao de queijo (best in NY!), the coixinhas and the feijoada. Drinks-wise, the mango caipirinha is incredible - if it's your first time here I recommend getting the caipirinha flight so you can try a few different flavors. Prices are bit high but food portions are huge and the consistent great quality makes it worth it. In terms of the ambience, it's pretty laidback/casual. They have two patios, one in the front and one in the back, that are beautifully decorated and really make you feel like you are in Brazil. Service is always consistently good, even when they are super busy.

The space is cozy and you do feel like you are in someone's kitchen. Tons of cocktails to pick from, including an espresso martini-like Cafe-rinha (strong! but loved it) and a Brazilian Passion that we subbed vodka in for (also great).

Pincanha a Cavalo - steak was done medium rare and I enjoyed it. The mushrooms on top added some umami and the potatoes had a slightly crispy skin. Came with beans and rice.
Chicken and waffles - not your typical waffles! These were actually made of Pao de Queijo (cheese bread), and little peppers and radishes helped cut through the sweetness of the maple syrup. Great combination of sweet/spicy/cheesy.
Pao de Queijo (not pictured) - small balls of the classic Brazilian cheese bread. Made fresh and so delicious! They have a somewhat mochi-like texture inside and aren't overly cheesy.

Everyone working at the restaurant was so friendly and welcoming - providing recommendations, patiently standing by while we spent ages yapping instead of ordering, and never rushing us throughout.

The menu is wildly expensive... I never thought I'd see feijoada being sold for more than $30 a plate!
We ordered some coxinhas and pão de queijo, along with a couple caipirinhas. Everything was just fine. Not great, not bad, just fine.

We ordered the beef and spinach empanadas and croquettes to start -- delicious. Great empanada texture and tasty filling. Croquettes also tasty and larger than expected with a yummy dipping sauce.

Ambiance was good. Not too loud. Not too bright. Not too dark. Just right for brunch (idk how it would be at dinner).

There is a front and back area to the restaurant. Overall, the place is very narrow, so don't expect a ton of room.

We ordered a bunch:

Flight of caipirinhas: regular was the best
Beef stroganoff: very good
Picanha with eggs: cooked very well. More steak than eggs, which is rare:
Empanadas - pretty good. They were out of chicken and beef unfortunately, so we got spinach and hearts of palm
Poa de quieco - pretty good, but honestly just cheesy bread
Brama beer - only place I've seen it outside of Brazil
Yuca fries -  amazing sauce
Chicken and waffles - very good

A few other things.

"berimbau-brazilian-kitchen-west-village-new-york","""08/07/2023""",4,"The ambiance outside of the restaurant, was nice; the patio was full of happy people and there was familiar Brazilian music playing inside the establishment. The server arrived quickly bringing us water and took our drink order. I noticed that the menu had a diverse array of brunch items that included brazilian fusion and traditional dishes, as well as a bunch of caipirinha options.

I ordered the guava and passionfruit caipirinha. The guava capirinha was a heavy pour of cachaça, accompanied by a strong lime accent to the guava juice. The passionfruit caipirinha was bright, citrusy, minty, and refreshing.

I ordered starters, specifically the 3 pasteis. You can order between beef, spinach and feta, cheese, or hearts of palm, but I chose to not order the cheese pasteis. It's accompanied by a wonderful thick garlicky sauce that gave a boost of flavor to each pastel. My favorite was the beef pastel, and then the spinach and feta. The hearts of palm pastel was sweet, which was unexpected since I had never tried it, but tasted even better with the garlic sauce.

For entrees, I ordered the savory pão de queijo waffle and feijoada (traditional). The meat on the waffle was soft and savory, the sauce that's on it mimics sweet and spicy sauce duck sauce, and the waffle itself was cheesy and salty (in the best possible way). The feijoada was hearty, flavorful, and accompanied by white rice and sautéed spinach salad (with mandarin oranges). The sausage used in the stew tasted like kielbasa but I was expecting linguiça, like a traditional feijoada. Nonetheless, the pork belly that was cooked in this stew was delicious. I didn't get a chance to try the salad because it was so much food on our table!

I will say, the server did take a while to run the card after we requested the check, but that may be because of how busy the restaurant was. It appears small when you first enter, but once you walk past the long hallway, you'll see more seating for bigger parties in the back of the restaurant.

After several moves, it fell off my radar, but I'm so glad I gave it another shot a few months ago! They've totally elevated the decor (yes, it's a little insta-trappy but the food and alcohol holds up so don't worry!). 

I recently rented out the roadside space for a party of ~20 guests and the Berimbau team--shoutout to Bianca and Iago--went above and beyond to make sure it went smoothly. The roadside space is bright and cheery (better than the back garden in my opinion), and sturdy too with plenty of plexiglass and enclosures to protect against rain! 

On to the drinks and food: while I find some of the caipirinhas cloyingly sweet, there's definitely something for everybody on their cocktail list. I was pleasantly surprised by their mulled wine cocktail in particular.

"berimbau-brazilian-kitchen-west-village-new-york","""21/02/2021""",2,"After numerous recommendations from a friend who've been there several times, I decided to make my birthday brunch at Berimbau Brazilian Kitchen. I made the reservation way in advance and did not have the option to choose indoor or garden, just table. When I arrived they said garden was by reservation only. Excuse me... am I chopped liver? They mentioned that if the garden reservations cancel, we could sit there but the guy never followed up which I did not appreciate. I ignored it and sat down where I was seated... outside in the cold. 

The table and floors were pretty much wiped down really clean so I felt very safe to sit there but it was honestly not off to a good start. 

To be straightforward, I will just list out the things that the waitress fernanda (I remembered bc I remember thinking it was really pretty name ironically...) really did not sit well with me:
1) we asked for paper napkins because the utensils weren't clean and didn't want to use the cloth napkins since covid times, and the waitress brought out 2. We are a party of 4, do you want us to share the napkins? Are you cheap with your napkins? I don't understand...
2) one of my guests did not get a plate as we were sharing the appetizers, so she resorted to using the plate the appetizer came out in. When I asked the waitress for a plate, my friend said it's fine since she was using the plate the appetizer came out in. Waitress didn't seem to care at all. We also ordered a lot of food and drinks, so when we asked her to clear out some empty cups from our flights, she seemed unhappy and went about trying to take it away. However, she tried to take a flight that was filled to the top and we said ""not that one we didn't drink that yet"" and she said ""then which one""? Ummm the empty ones obviously?? 
3) the waitress brought out our food and spilled one of the caipirinha flight where the drink went through the space on the table onto my leggings and shoes. It's no biggie, but the waitress didn't apologize or offer napkins so I can clean the drink off my clothes or offer a new drink. After I moved around, she acted as if nothing was wrong and continued to tell me how Brazilians eat stroganoff. I kindly listened in my alcohol infused leggings. 
4) waitress kept leaving the outdoor area with the door open letting the cold air hit our backs. We were wearing our jackets but it was still so cold. It seemed like she was keeping it opened on purpose. Hopefully it wasn't personal, but every time we closed it, she would open it again and again...
5) she brought a meal to us.. the meal we ordered but took it away because it was for the table next to us. First of all, get your tables right. Second of all, I would not want to be the receiver of a plate that you put down on another table. Third of all, we were there before the other table who got their entrees ... but that's besides the point. 
6) friend asked to bring the leftovers to go but she took it away. Came back and we asked what happened to the food and she said she threw it away because she misunderstood. Miscommunications often happen and I totally understand, but there was no apology whatsoever. She didn't apologize or say let me see what I can do since it was HER mistake. She just shrugged and went about her day. 
7) the reservation said it was my birthday and no one wished me a happy birthday or did anything special. I didn't expect anything but this is just something I noticed compared to other restaurants and I didn't feel like it was a special experience compared to other restaurants I've been to for a celebration. 

Even with all the negative things that happened, I gave them two stars for the following reason.. 
1) food was excellent 
2) when I asked for the manager, she was extremely apologetic and did give compensation for the horrible experience I had. I honestly would have appreciated an apology from the waitress and an explanation of why her service was so poor. Regardless, I appreciate the manager very much and her trying to do right. 

All in all, I'm hoping this was an anomaly, and maybe I'll be back for the good food. Perhaps take out so I don't have to travel so far to be mistreated in the cold weather.","{""Friends"":416,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/yruPfmljCoTtTPdG5tLrqw/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Stamford, CT"",""Photos"":479,""Reviews_made"":262,""Tag"":""Elite24"",""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BWZzuWmB-s9RJG_qDsuo3g"",""Username"":""Christina L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/zHyvRjbUeBm4wejjajxq-Q/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/iWopuxoFIQk_syMAJsYE7w/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/PW97TCGP7kYlpUw5wRRfNA/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BX88MhQLMdct0oWpVlQy6g/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":5,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":3,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",110,"Elite from 24","0 check-in","Berimbau Brazilian Kitchen - West Village"

We got the caipirinha flights which are only offered during brunch - for $24 you can select four caipirinha flavors out of their regular menu. I got the spicy, mango, classic, and guava and all four were delicious. For food, I ordered the Picanha burger which was good but not particularly special. I did try some of my friend's Bobo de Camarao and thought it was quite good.

Giving 4 stars for the ambiance and drinks.

I would have given them full points if only the staff was more knowledgeable about vegan and non vegan option, you have to be careful to eat out here. The waitress recommended pasties with artichoke citing it was vegan but it was full of cheese. Also they later mentioned the seasoning they give out with their meals have bacon powder in it. I think it is something to mention beforehand if you notice someone with vegan diet dining in your restaurant. The vegan Stroganoff was good but too heavy on coconut maybe replace it with cashew sauce or vegan cream.

One thing I miss is spice from this (not berimbau, but Brazilian in general) as I think that would take it up to 5/5. Also wish it was served in a terracota pot to keep this dish hot/warm as it did cool down quite quickly, and it's definitely much better hot. 

Bobo de camarao - 4/5. Delicious flavor, and served in a little pot! Less seafood than the Moqueca, and I might give the edge to Moqueca on flavor. 

Cachaca pineapple drink was decent, but not my favorite.

FOOD: Food was absolutely delicious. We had the pao, all the vegetarian empanadas, the vegan feijoada and a chicken stroganoff. The food came quick and was delicious and hearty - perfect because we were seated outside on a cold night
DRINKS: We had two rounds of classic caipirinhas and they did not disappoint. They were nice and strong and a good complement to the warm and creamy food
SERVICE: While there was a slight wait for our table from our reservation time, the waiters were all very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed at all times. We snagged a reservation in their back garden and it was very cute! Well lit with heaters albeit a little cold - but once we got eating it was perfect!

To start off the meal, the pao de queijo is a must. It's a type of cheesy bread that will keep you wanting more. I also ordered their traditional alcoholic beverage, the Caipirinha, which is absolutely delicious. I tried both the original and mango-flavored ones- seriously the best Caipirinha I've ever had! They'll even give you the good quality stuff, straight from Brazil. For my main course, I had the Bobo de Camarao, which was a type of shrimp stew in coconut milk. This was definitely a hit, as the shrimp was delicious and the gravy was so flavorful and rich due to the coconut milk. To end my delicious meal, I also had the pleasure of trying their Brigadeiros. Along with the delicious chocolate fugde, these had the delightful surprise of having som rum added to it. So honestly, you can't go wrong with ANY of these choices at all.

"berimbau-brazilian-kitchen-west-village-new-york","""09/08/2021""",4,"I had brunch here with my dad and this was our first touch to Brazilian food ever. I made a reservation @ 11:15 AM on a Saturday morning thru Resty. The outdoor seating area is very pretty and they have proper AC  Service and staff is good. Here's what we ordered:

Pão de queijo: delicious appetizer to share! It's not too cheesy, I liked this a lot. 5/5
Stroganoff: 5/5, my dad said that this was the best stroganoff he has had. It was very filling, no need to eat anything for almost the rest of the day. 
Brazilian toast: Has a lot of berries, brioche and a touch of cardamom & cinnamon which made the toast very tasty - it's not necessarily sweet in an overly sweet way which I liked. However, I found $18 to be a liiiittle overpriced. 
Caipirinha Flight: $24 for four very small glasses. Note that the size is inherently made for tasting only. taste of alcohol is strong in these ones. I drank the two in the middle and mid-way through the pink one, my stomach started to hurt: shrugged it off yet the ache went on for hours. I'm not a newbie to alcohol so it remains a mystery if it was simply too strong for me or if there was actually something wrong with the drink. 

Overall a pleasing brunch. Expensive, but enjoyable - don't know if I would run here again out of all the other brunch spots around the area but this left me curious about Brazilian food.","{""Friends"":0,""Image"":""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/photo/Q8MtHKoNzyMTG2mm3kinyA/60s.jpg"",""Location"":""Elmhurst, New York, NY"",""Photos"":25,""Reviews_made"":14,""URL"":""https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bCucxWVcCMcX7QjiuHxjqA"",""Username"":""Saara L.""}","[""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-HFAqf6s-FMnzVX6hgw2rQ/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/c3EhuXJOUzCCLZizeyN0rg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oWcrMEN1TVsUsNLt10CQfg/348s.jpg"",""https://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/YjCNuenqE4oZQrx0yzdzQQ/348s.jpg""]","[{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Helpful""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Thanks""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Love this""},{""Number"":0,""Title"":""Oh no""}]","null",209,"","0 check-in","Berimbau Brazilian Kitchen - West Village"

I went to eat dinner with my wife and friends and we had such an incredible night to say the least! Our server, Isabela, was so friendly and recommended some delicious apps, drinks and entrees. We had passionfruit Caipirinhas, coxinhas, and yucca fries for appetizer, followed by a filet mignon stroganoff, shrimp Bobo, and a seafood dish. Everything was absolutely delicious! Afterwards we had a fantastic flan that hit the spot. The manager was kind enough to come to our table and introduce herself and asked if we were being taken care of. I love when management does this. Also, we met the chef and took a pic with him. Overall, we give Berimbau 5 stars! and an extra star for the most delicious coxinhas I've ever had in my life!

Aside from how well they treated me, the food was fantastic! We started off with the Pao de Queiji (cheese bread) and were tempted to order more. The Caipirinha drinks were great too. For the entrees, I got the Moqueca (seafood stew). The broth had the perfect consistency and was super flavorful with a nice kick but without being too spicy, while there was a very healthy portion of fish all cooked perfectly. My friend got the Picanha (Brazilian steak) which he fortunately let me try, as it was full of flavor with an amazing crust on the outside. 

The whole entire staff was extremely friendly, and the service was flawless.
